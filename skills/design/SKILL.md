description: "Use when the shape of a system is being decided or reviewed: a purpose brief, a process map, an architecture decision record, a technology map, a conceptual to logical to physical data model, diagrams as code, or a verification plan. Runs the six design phases in order, each gating the next, and checks the dossier for the artifacts its tier requires. Invoke as /brothersbe:design."

# Design

Design comes before verification. The expensive mistakes are made while deciding what to
build, how the process runs, what shape the system takes, and how the data is modeled.
Checking the result at the end catches none of them.

## Load the law for the phase you are in, and not the rest

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/SKILL.md` first, then load only what the routing table sends you
to:

| You are doing this | Read |
|---|---|
| purpose brief, process map | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/phases-purpose-and-process.md` |
| architecture, technology map, data model | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/phases-architecture-and-data.md` |
| diagrams, dossier documentation | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/phase-expression.md` |
| tiering a task, checking required artifacts | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/laws-tier-and-artifacts.md` |
| writing or reviewing an ADR, data model or diagram | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/laws-design-artifacts.md` |
| consulting a decision table | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/laws-decision-tables.md` |

## The artifacts

Templates live in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/dossier/`, numbered in the order they are
written: 01 purpose, 02 process, 03 ADR, 04 technology map, 05 data model, 06 diagrams,
07 verification. The tier decides which are required. An architecture decision is taken from a
decision table with named criteria and thresholds (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/tables/`), and the
ADR records the recommendation, the first and second alternative, and what would flip it.

## The completeness check

```
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/sbe" design --strict <dossier-or-repo-root>
```

An empty directory reports NO-DATA naming why, never "clean". A declared dossier root holding
no dossier is a FAIL, not silence.

## Stop conditions

L6's four forcing conditions apply inside every phase: an ambiguity that would change the
design, a contradiction between what was stated and what the code or data shows, a collision
with a hard gate (money, partner data, personal data, production state), or a disproven
assumption. Any one of them stops the work mid-artifact and asks, in the fixed checkpoint
shape: what I found, my recommendation, the alternatives, the one decision I need, and what I
will do if you say nothing.
