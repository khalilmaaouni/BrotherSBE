name: verify
description: Use when work is about to be called done, a figure that could reach a decision has been produced, a schema migration is part of the change, the change touches money or a partner path, or a verification plan is being written. Runs the hard gates and reports PASS, FAIL or NO-DATA with the evidence each verdict actually read. Invoke as /brothersbe:verify.

# Verify

An agent earns trust in exact proportion to how mechanically its output can be checked.
This skill is that rule pointed at the finished work.

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/SKILL.md`, then
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/phase-verification.md` and
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/laws-hard-gates.md` (L7 to L10).

## Run verify once, through the command that mints its own evidence

```
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/sbe" verify <dir>
```

This single command already runs the design completeness check (`sbe_design.py --strict`),
the four hard gates together (`sbe_gate.py`: numbers, migration, approval, ran), and the
scored surface (`sbe_score.py --strict`), in that order, and prints every verdict line each
one produces. These four gates plus the silent-failure lints are refused rather than waived:
an operator instruction in session can override a default, never a hard gate.

It then mints one evidence receipt per delegate (design, gate, score) into `.sbe/evidence`,
the same store `sbe status` reads (CR-08, `design/lifecycle-blockers/03-adr.md`), so a clean
run leaves proof behind instead of a PASS `sbe status` cannot see. A receipt minted against a
dirty tree still reads NO-DATA, naming the dirty state: that is correct, not a bug, the first
time it is surprising.

For the stricter soft-finding surface `bin/sbe verify` does not itself request, also run:

```
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/sbe" score --strict --strict-soft <dir>
```

## How to read a verdict

- **PASS** means required evidence was inspected and met the control.
- **FAIL** means required evidence was inspected and violated it.
- **NO-DATA** means the control examined nothing, and it names why. NO-DATA is never a pass,
  and a run that opened no file reports NO-DATA rather than "clean".

Report the verdict with the command that produced it and the evidence it names. Never
summarize a gate you did not run, and never re-word a NO-DATA into a pass because the work
looks right.

## After running, read what remains from the engine, not from memory

```
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/sbe" status --json
```

Do not re-derive what is left from the verdict lines above by eye. Read `missingEvidence`: a
clean run just minted the design, gate and score receipts, so an obligation still listed there
names something this run did not clear (most often a dirty tree at mint time, or a tier that
owes a check kind no delegate above covers). Read `nextAction` for the single recommended move
afterward, and `notes` for the per-section line behind it.

## The honest limit on all of it, today

These gates check the internal shape of an evidence file. They do not yet check where that
file came from. A receipt can be written by the same agent whose work it is meant to verify,
and a fabricated duration, exit code, row count or rerun result still satisfies the schema.
Commit-bound, wrapper-generated evidence is the next thing being built. Until it lands, treat
a local PASS as advisory and read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/KNOWN-LIMITS.md`.
