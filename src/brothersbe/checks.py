"""The registry that says WHICH command a check is, so a receipt can prove the
right command ran and not merely that a command ran.

The defect this exists for, in one sentence: `sbe evidence run` proves a process
started, was timed and exited, so `-- true` mints a clean, sealed, commit-bound
receipt, and the only thing naming which obligation it answered was `--kind`, a
word the caller typed beside it.

    The command ran.
    The command was the registered check required for this change.

The first sentence was provable and the second was not, and a control that can
only prove the first is a control that clears an obligation for `true`.

`.sbe/checks.yml` moves the command out of the caller's hands. A registered
check names its executable, its exact argument vector, its working directory,
the files it is evidence for, and the runner files whose bytes ARE the check.
`sbe evidence run --check <id>` resolves all of that from the registry and
accepts no substitution: there is no argument on that path that changes what
runs. The receipt then records the check id, its kind, the SHA256 of its
specification, the runner hashes and the covered hashes, and `sbe evidence
verify` recomputes every one of them against the registry as it stands NOW. A
registry edit, a renamed runner, a changed argument vector or a modified runner
script therefore invalidates every receipt minted before it, which is the whole
point: those receipts describe a check that no longer exists.

WHAT THIS STILL CANNOT PROVE, stated here rather than in a footnote. This module
binds a receipt to a registered COMMAND. It does not understand what that
command does. A registry entry that points `migration-rehearsal` at a script
which prints nothing and exits zero is a false registry, and the defence against
that is the registry being part of the protected control plane (`.sbe/checks.yml`
is named in `.sbe/policy.yml`'s control-plane rule, so changing it owes
control-plane evidence and a protected approval) rather than anything this file
can compute.

THE REGISTRY IS THIS REPOSITORY'S, NOT A TEMPLATE'S. Only checks whose runner
files actually exist here are registered. A check this repository owes and
cannot yet run is listed under `unregistered:` WITH ITS REASON instead of being
pointed at a script that does not exist: an entry nobody can run would report a
broken command where the truth is that the check has not been built, and the
policy engine reporting MISSING for it is the honest outcome.

Python floor is 3.9: no match statements, no `X | Y` annotations. Standard
library only, and the YAML subset parser is this repository's own
(`brothersbe.program`), not a dependency.
