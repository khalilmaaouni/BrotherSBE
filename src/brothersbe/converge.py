"""Does the code between two commits still match the approved design.

Spec of record: docs/specs/2026-07-30-sbe-converge.md. Five dimensions
(SCOPE, CONTRACTS, DATA, ARCHITECTURE, VERIFICATION), each grounded in a
deterministic fact: a file, an operation, an entity, a receipt, a sha. No
LLM anywhere. There is no force flag and none may be added: the only path
from divergence to PASS is amending the dossier, regenerating the plan, and
regenerating the evidence, which the fixtures walk end to end.

The report written to <dossier>/09-convergence.json carries no timestamps,
so two runs over the same tree are byte-identical.
