"""Generate a receipt by RUNNING the command, and refuse to read one that was
merely written.

The defect this exists for, in one sentence: every receipt this project reads
today can be typed by hand by the same agent whose work it verifies, so a
fabricated duration, exit code, row count or rerun id satisfies the schema and a
gate PASSes on a run nobody's command ever performed.

Two bindings close it, and both are stated with their limits because a control
that oversells itself is worse than none:

1. THE COMMAND IS RUN HERE. `sbe evidence run -- <command...>` executes the
   command through `subprocess`, times it, and records what it observed. There
   is no argument that writes a duration or an exit code; those come from the
   run or the receipt does not exist. This is the binding that matters, and it
   is why this module is a wrapper rather than a validator.
2. THE RECEIPT IS BOUND TO A COMMIT AND TO FILE CONTENT. `headCommit` must be
   the head at verify time, and every file the receipt claims to cover must
   still hold the bytes whose digest the receipt recorded. Evidence made against
   code that has since changed is evidence about a different program.

WHAT THE SEAL IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. `runId` is a SHA256 over the receipt's own
run facts, recomputed at verify time. It is TAMPER EVIDENCE against hand
authoring: a plausible receipt typed to satisfy the schema does not carry a
matching seal and is refused by name. It is NOT a signature. Anybody who can
read this file can compute a matching seal, because the input is the receipt
itself and the key is nothing. So a locally generated receipt is never more than
LOCAL-ADVISORY, and the only receipt this project will call PROTECTED-CI is one
minted where `SBE_CI_RUN_ID` was set by an environment the agent does not
control. `show` prints that trust level on every receipt, every time, so the
distinction is never something a reader has to remember.

DIGESTS, NEVER RAW OUTPUT. `stdout` and `stderr` are recorded as SHA256 digests
and byte counts only. A receipt is a file that gets committed, pasted into a
pull request and shipped to whoever asks for evidence, and a command that prints
a token, a connection string or a customer row would otherwise persist it
forever in the one artifact everybody is encouraged to share. The digest proves
the same bytes came back; it carries none of them.

WHICH CHECK RAN IS DECLARED, NEVER INFERRED FROM THE COMMAND LINE. `--kind`
records, as a first-class sealed field, which of this project's obligations the
run is offered against (`design`, `gate`, `score`). It exists because the
consumer of these receipts used to work the identity out for itself, by
substring-matching the recorded `argv`: a receipt for `/bin/cat
tests/test_design_of_gate_score.txt` named all three words, so one command that
ran no check at all cleared three obligations at once. Nothing about that was
hypothetical; it was reproduced. The field moves the claim from a guess a reader
makes about a string to a statement the receipt carries.

What the field IS: a declaration made at generation time, bound to a run that
actually happened, sealed with everything else, so it cannot be added to a
receipt afterwards and cannot be given to a command that never ran. What it is
NOT: proof of what the command did. This wrapper starts a process and times it;
it does not understand the process. An operator who types `--kind design` over a
command that checks nothing has written a false declaration, and the receipt
records the argv right beside it so a reader can see the two disagree. A receipt
that declares no kind clears no obligation, and one written before this field
existed is legacy: NO-DATA for obligation purposes, never a silent pass.

AND THE DECLARATION IS NO LONGER THE IDENTITY. `--kind` above closed the
inference bypass and left the one under it standing: a declaration is a word the
caller types, so `-- true --kind gate` still minted a clean, sealed,
commit-bound receipt for a command that checked nothing. `sbe evidence run
--check <id>` resolves the executable, the exact argument vector, the working
directory, the covered paths and the environment out of `.sbe/checks.yml`, a
registry inside the protected control plane, and accepts NO substitution: a
command after `--`, a `--covers` or a `--kind` beside it is refused rather than
quietly overridden. The receipt records `checkId`, `checkKind`,
`checkSpecSha256`, the executable and its hash, every runner file hash, the argv
and the working directory, all sealed, and `verify` recomputes every one of them
against the registry as it stands NOW, so a redefined check or a modified runner
invalidates the receipts minted before it. The free-form mode stays for local
experimentation and it is always LOCAL-ADVISORY, whatever the tree state and
whatever CI run id is set, because nothing outside the caller says what it was.
What this still cannot prove is the registry itself: an entry pointing an
important-sounding id at a command that checks nothing is a false registry, and
what defends against that is `.sbe/checks.yml` being in the control-plane rule
of `.sbe/policy.yml`, not anything computed here.

ARGV IS DIFFERENT, AND ONLY PARTLY FIXED. Unlike stdout and stderr, `argv` has
to be recorded as text: a receipt whose command was paraphrased proves nothing
about what happened. So a credential typed ON the command line used to be
persisted into the receipt verbatim, and the receipt is the one artifact
everybody is encouraged to share. `redact_argv()` now masks any token matching
a KNOWN secret shape before `argv` is written, reusing (not reinventing) the
same `SECRET_PATTERNS` `tools/sbe_telemetry.py` already scans an operator's own
messages with. Each match becomes a named marker, `[REDACTED:<shape>]`, and the
receipt records `argvRedactions`, the count, so a reader knows whether `argv` is
still verbatim (0) or not. This narrows the limit; it does not close it. The
pattern list is finite by nature, so a secret in a shape the list does not know
still reaches the receipt untouched. That residual is stated, not hidden, in
`docs/KNOWN-LIMITS.md`.

Python floor is 3.9: no match statements, no `X | Y` annotations. Standard
library only, because zero dependencies is a promise on this project's front
page and an evidence generator is the last place to retract it.

    `check_id`, when given, is the REGISTERED mode and it is the mode this
    module now exists for. The executable, the argument vector, the working
    directory, the covered paths and the environment all come from
    `.sbe/checks.yml`; `argv`, `covers` and `kinds` must be empty, and a caller
    that supplies any of them is refused rather than quietly overridden, because
    a substitution that succeeds silently is exactly the caller-supplied command
    the registry replaces.

    The command runs HERE. Nothing in the signature accepts a duration, an exit
    code or an output digest, which is the whole point: those three are the
    fields a hand-written receipt gets to invent today.

    `kinds` is the operator's declaration of WHICH obligation this run is
    offered against, from `CHECK_KIND_NAMES`, and it is the one thing here the
    wrapper takes on trust rather than observes. It is taken anyway, because
    the alternative shipped for a wave and was worse: the consumer guessed the
    identity from the command line, and a command that ran no check cleared
    three obligations by having three words in a filename. A declaration is
    checkable by a reader against the argv recorded next to it; a guess is not.

    `timeout`, in seconds, is None unless the caller passes `--timeout`. There
    is no default: a silent one would kill a legitimate long suite and hand
    back a receipt about a run that never finished, which is the exact
    false-positive pattern this project's kill criteria warn against. When it
    is set and the command outruns it, `subprocess.run` kills the child and
    waits for it (that is Python's own contract for `timeout=`, not something
    hand-rolled here), and this raises `ReceiptUnreadable` rather than writing
    a receipt: no exit code was ever observed, so there is nothing honest to
    seal, and the caller's stderr names what happened instead.

    the FIXED path `<evidence_dir>/<kind>.json`, and return `(written,
    failures)`: `written` the paths actually written, `failures` a list of
    `(kind, exception)` for the pairs that were not.

    This is the helper `sbe verify`'s default minting uses (`cli.py`'s
    `_cmd_verify`, by way of `_mint_evidence`), so minting several receipts
    at once stays inside this module's own generate-then-write path instead
    of `cli.py` growing a parallel writer that fabricates a receipt's fields
    from a run it already watched happen. Every `generate()` call here runs
    `argv` again, because THE COMMAND IS RUN HERE is this module's own law
    (see the module docstring): a receipt has to observe an actual run,
    never restate one somebody else watched.

    EVERY PAIR IS GENERATED BEFORE ANY OF THEM IS WRITTEN, and that order is
    the reason this function exists beside a simpler generate-then-write
    loop. `evidence_dir` sits inside `cwd`, the same tree `generate()` reads
    `git status --porcelain` against to decide `workingTreeDirty` for EACH
    receipt (`working_tree_dirty`); write one receipt at a time -- generate,
    write, generate, write -- and the first receipt's own file is a new
    untracked path by the time the second one asks whether the tree is
    dirty, so only the first of several receipts minted together could ever
    read clean, and every one after it reads NO-DATA for a reason that has
    nothing to do with the code under test and everything to do with this
    function's own prior write. Generating every receipt first, against the
    tree exactly as the caller found it, then writing every one that
    generated successfully, means every receipt's dirty state reflects one
    shared truth about that tree, never a cascade this function created by
    writing into the thing it was reading.

    A FIXED path per kind, not one namespaced by time or run id, is
    deliberate for a second reason: `evidence.verify`'s own `exclude_dirs`
    parameter, the same machinery `status.py`'s `_scan_evidence` already
    passes, treats a receipt regenerated at a fixed `--out` path as the
    ordinary shape of a routine re-run rather than a change to the code
    under test (see `docs/KNOWN-LIMITS.md`, "Evidence covering evidence").
    Without a fixed path, every `sbe verify` would mint a new file and the
    store would grow without bound; with one, running `sbe verify` twice
    regenerates the same receipts in place, the shape that exclusion
    machinery already expects.

    A failure generating or writing one pair does not stop the others: each
    is attempted independently and its exception, if any, lands in
    `failures` rather than being raised, so one broken delegate does not
    cost the receipts the other delegates earned.
