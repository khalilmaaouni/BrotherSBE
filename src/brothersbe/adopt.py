"""Inspect a repository for BrotherSBE readiness, and propose what it is
missing, without silently changing anything.

The defect this exists for, in one sentence: `cli.py` used to refuse `sbe
adopt` outright, naming the reason as "the adoption doctor cannot yet tell a
protected repository from an unprotected one, and a readiness report that
omits that is worse than none." Saying nothing was safer than a report that
could not make that distinction.

THE KILL CRITERION THIS MODULE IS BUILT AROUND: the report must never claim a
protection is PRESENT when the GitHub API was never asked. Branch protection,
required status checks, and "review from a code owner is required" are
settings on the code review platform, not on the filesystem. Nothing in a git
clone can read them, and this module holds no GitHub credentials and asks for
none. So `adoption_report`'s `protections` list reports every one of those
three as UNVERIFIABLE-HERE, unconditionally, and names what reading it would
take (a GitHub token with repo scope, and admin rights on the repository)
rather than inferring PRESENT from a local proxy (a CODEOWNERS file exists) or
ABSENT from its absence. A CODEOWNERS file existing locally IS a fact this
tool can read, and it is reported separately, under `localFacts`, so the two
are never folded into one claim that neither earns on its own.

Stack detection reuses the SAME path patterns `sbe impact` already carries for
contract, migration and dbt-shaped files (`brothersbe.impact.DETECTORS`),
walked over the whole tree instead of a diff, so a pattern that means "this is
an OpenAPI document" in one tool means the same thing in the other. One rule,
one table, read twice.

Everything this module writes is a PROPOSAL. `--dry-run` (the default, in
cli.py) prints every proposed file as a unified diff and writes nothing at
all; `--apply` writes, never overwrites an existing file that differs without
`--force`, and a second `--apply` over unchanged proposals writes nothing and
says so, because the proposals themselves are deterministic: nothing about
them (dates, run ids) changes between two runs against the same tree.

The repository policy file this proposes is NOT wave 3's eventual schema.
Wave 3 (a repository policy file plus its own JSON schema, per the plugin
conversion plan) has not shipped as this module is written. What is proposed
here is a provisional shape, labelled as such in the file it writes, built
from what this module can already detect. Full limits: `docs/KNOWN-LIMITS.md`.
