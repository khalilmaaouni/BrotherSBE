"""Install BrotherSBE's local footprint into a target repository: a config
file, a dossier directory, an optional copy of the consumer CI, and a receipt
naming exactly what was written and how to remove it.

Idempotent is the whole point. `sbe init --apply` run twice must change
nothing the second time, and say so, because an install step that silently
does something different on a rerun is a step nobody can trust in a script.
That works here because every proposal is DETERMINISTIC content (no
timestamp, no run id) compared byte for byte against what is already on
disk: the second run finds every proposal already matches and writes
nothing, and the receipt -- the one artifact that legitimately does carry a
timestamp -- is then left untouched rather than rewritten with a new one,
because nothing happened this run for it to describe.

The generated config also carries the team profile: `.sbe/team-profile.json`
in the TARGET repository when it has one, otherwise this installation's own
copy, read by `load_team_profile()` below and folded into `.brothersbe/
config.json` field by field. Exactly one field set is supported (dossierRoot,
vaultPathPattern, ci, codeGuideDepth, schemaVersion -- the same five names
install.sh has always advertised reading). Anything else the profile file
contains is REJECTED BY NAME rather than silently dropped, because a field a
team added and never saw applied is a worse failure than a field that never
existed: the first looks like it worked.

`--dry-run` (the default, wired in cli.py) shows every intended mutation as a
diff and writes nothing; `--apply` writes. Refuses outside a git repository,
naming the reason, because there is nowhere for the config, the dossier
directory or the receipt to be versioned, and installing outside version
control is not this command's job to guess is wanted.
