"""LT-301: explicit human handover. `12-handover.json` makes ownership
transfer complete only after a human receiver explicitly accepts it.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A completion message in chat is not a record: nobody can
`sbe status` it, nobody can prove later who accepted what, and "I told them"
is not evidence. This module writes ONE artifact, `12-handover.json`, inside
the dossier being handed off, bound to the commit it was prepared at, and it
stays the outgoing owner's until a named human receiver runs `acknowledge`.
Rejecting keeps ownership with the outgoing owner too, with the reason on
record. Nothing here changes who owns a task in `.sbe/tasks.json`: this
module only ever READS the task registry, never writes it, so "no task owner
is changed until acknowledgment succeeds" is true by construction rather than
by a check that could be bypassed.

WHAT `prepare` DERIVES, and does not ask for. Everything the engine already
knows comes from readers this project already ships, reused rather than
retyped:
  - the task registry (`brothersbe.tasks.load_registry`) for who holds which
    plan task open, closed clean, or never opened;
  - the dossier's own `08-plan.json` for the task graph itself;
  - the evidence store (`brothersbe.status._scan_evidence`, the same reader
    `sbe status --team` uses) for which receipts are current, stale or
    unavailable;
  - `09-convergence.json`, `10-approval.json` and `11-review.json`, read and
    judged for staleness the same way `brothersbe.status.build_team_report`
    already judges them: bound to a commit, and a bound commit that is not
    the current HEAD is stale, never silently re-read as current;
  - `working_tree_dirty` (`brothersbe.evidence`) and the task registry's own
    declared worktrees, for which trees carry uncommitted state.
Only two things cannot be read off any of that: who the outgoing owner and
the intended receiver ARE (`--outgoing`/`--receiver`), and a rejection's
reason (`--reject --reason`). Those, and only those, are asked for.

IDENTITY COMPARISON is not reinvented here. `tools/sbe_gate.py` already closed
seven forgeries of "is this the same person" for the self-approval guard on
the money gate (a trailing period, a reordered name, an initial, a
plus-address, a gmail dot-fold, a homoglyph, an invisible character): see
`sbe_gate._identity_parts`, `_canonical_email` and `_names_overlap`. This
module imports that machinery rather than writing a second, weaker fold, for
"receiver equals outgoing owner" and "receiver equals a registered agent
identity" alike.

THE CR-09 SHAPE THIS MIRRORS: a handover record NEVER JUDGES ITSELF. `status`
stays exactly what `prepare` wrote ("prepared") until `acknowledge` or
`reject` changes it; staleness (bound commit versus current HEAD) is worked
out fresh at every read, in `show` and again, as a hard refusal, inside
`acknowledge`. A prepared record is a frozen snapshot: if a task closes or
opens after `prepare` ran with no new commit, the record still shows what was
true when it was written, exactly the way an old `11-review.json` is never
silently rewritten to match a tree that moved on without a new review.

CONCURRENCY: two `acknowledge` (or `reject`) calls racing the same dossier are
serialized by an `fcntl.flock` sidecar (`12-handover.json.lock`), the same
pattern `brothersbe.tasks._registry_lock` already uses for the task registry,
held across the whole read-check-write. The first writer's atomic rename
(temp file, then `os.replace`) lands; the second reads the now-updated
`status` and is refused, never a lost update and never a torn file.

Python floor is 3.9: no match statements, no `X | Y` annotations. Standard
library only.
