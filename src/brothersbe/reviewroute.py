"""Decide which read-only specialist reviewers, if any, should look at a
change, from the diff alone. No model chooses a reviewer here; nothing here
runs a review either. It only routes.

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR, in one sentence: a review workflow that always
convenes every specialist teaches nobody to trust it (a T0 docs fix waits on
seven agents that read nothing relevant), and a review workflow with no rule
at all lets a migration or a secret slip past because nobody happened to
mention it. This module is the deterministic middle: it looks at the same
detector hits `brothersbe.impact` already computes from a diff, adds a small
number of content-level detectors `impact` does not carry (a migration
hidden in a generic filename, SQL embedded in a host language, a secret-shaped
value outside a file `impact` would flag by name, a documentation sentence
that made a control promise and was removed, a test-only change that weakens
an assertion, evidence that fails its own verification), and turns the result
into at most two reviewer names, a tier, and named reasons.

THE ONE RULE THAT MAKES THIS SAFE: this module never invents a second tier
ladder. The tier it reports is exactly what `brothersbe.impact` already
computes (the human's declared tier when readable, the diff-derived tier as a
floor otherwise); none of the detectors added here feed into that
computation. A reviewer choice is never allowed to raise or lower the tier
that governs how much evidence a change owes -- it only decides who looks,
never how much is owed.

WHAT DETERMINISM MEANS HERE. `route()` reads the diff between two commits,
the intake file if one is discoverable, and the evidence store if one exists,
and nothing else: no clock, no random source, no model call. The same two
commits, on the same tree, produce the same route every time it is run on
this repository's own fixtures.

SELECTION, in the order the rules are tried (the FULL statement, priority
first): migration beats security beats data beats backend beats
infrastructure beats QA beats evidence, which is TRIGGER_RULES below and the
one place this order is written down. At most two reviewers are ever
selected, in priority order, and how many slots exist depends only on the
tier: zero triggers is always zero reviewers regardless of tier (this is what
makes a T0 documentation change mechanical-only, without a special case for
it); one trigger or more at T0/T1 gets one reviewer; T2/T3 gets up to two.
Every trigger that fired but lost its slot to a higher-priority one is named
in `unmeasured`, by trigger and by the reviewer it would have selected,
never silently dropped.

WHAT THIS NEVER CLAIMS. `mechanicalOnly: true` or `primaryReviewer: null`
never means "this change is clean" -- it means no trigger this module knows
how to detect fired. A file type nothing here can read is named in
`unmeasured` by name, never folded into a quiet pass. This module has no
verdict vocabulary of its own: `verdict` in its report is `ROUTED` (a route
was computed) or `NO-DATA` (there was no diff to read at all), and it is
never `PASS`, because a route is not a review and this module runs no review.
