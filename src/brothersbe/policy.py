"""Prove that evidence SHOULD exist, then say whether it does.

The defect this exists for, in one sentence: this project is strong at rejecting
broken evidence and was weak at proving evidence was owed, so a gate could
report NO-DATA, a receipt directory could be left empty, a dossier input could
be omitted, and a strict run then completed without ever proving the change was
entitled to carry nothing.

    A valid receipt is checked carefully.
    A missing receipt may never be required.

That asymmetry is the whole bypass: an agent avoids a gate by avoiding the
declaration that activates it. This module removes the declaration from the
loop. `.sbe/policy.yml` says which paths owe which checks, tiers and approvals;
the requirement is derived from the DIFF, which the author cannot omit, and not
from an input somebody remembered to pass.

THE SIX STATES, AND WHY NO-DATA IS NOT ONE OF THEM.

    SATISFIED     the requirement is met by evidence this run actually read
    MISSING       required and absent. Nonzero exit, always
    INVALID       present and broken (unreadable, malformed, failed verify)
    STALE         present and bound to a different head commit
    UNPROTECTED   present and valid, but only locally attested, where the
                  policy requires protected evidence
    NOT-REQUIRED  no rule matched this change

NO-DATA used to carry two opposite meanings here: "nothing was required" and
"what was required is not there". One of those is a clean bill of health and the
other is the failure this file exists to catch, and a single word for both is
how the failure kept reading as the clean one. So NO-DATA is not in the
vocabulary of this module at all, and a test asserts it never appears in a
requirement state.

THE TIER IS A FLOOR, NEVER A CEILING, and this is the second place that sentence
is enforced (`brothersbe.impact` is the first, over detectors rather than over
declared policy). `minimumTier` is the LOWEST tier a change touching those paths
may be classified at. This engine RAISES a declared tier that sits under the
floor. It lowers one only against a decision record carrying a protected
approval, and without that record a lowering is INVALID and blocks. A tier that
can be lowered by editing one number in an intake file is not a control.

WAIVED IS NEVER PASS. An exception is a decision somebody made, so it carries a
reason, an owner, an expiry and a protected approval, and it is rendered as its
own word. A waiver missing any of the four is REFUSED and the requirement keeps
its failing state. For the rules that declare `strictWaivers` (control plane,
production infrastructure, migration, money, personal and partner data) an
accepted waiver still blocks: it records the decision, it does not clear it.

WHICH CHECK RAN IS THE REGISTRY'S ANSWER, NOT THE CALLER'S. A required check is
satisfied only by a receipt whose `checkId` the evidence wrapper resolved out of
`.sbe/checks.yml`, so SATISFIED now means the registered command ran, with the
registered arguments, over the files that check covers, against runner bytes
that still hash the same. `checkKinds`, the field the CALLER supplies, clears
nothing: it is read only so a MISSING requirement can say "a receipt offered
this name through the caller-supplied field and could not be credited for it"
instead of sending an operator to look for a receipt sitting right there.

WHAT THIS STILL CANNOT PROVE, stated here rather than in a footnote: the
registry itself. An entry pointing an important-sounding id at a command that
checks nothing is a false registry, and what defends against that is
`.sbe/checks.yml` sitting in the control-plane rule above, so changing it owes
control-plane evidence and a protected approval. That is a review control, not a
computed one. Every report carries this limit in `limits`.

Python floor is 3.9: no match statements, no `X | Y` annotations. Standard
library only, and the YAML subset parser is this repository's own
(`brothersbe.program`), not a dependency.
