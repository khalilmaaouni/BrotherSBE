"""One truthful, blocker-first answer to "where does this change stand", so an
engineer never has to assemble it from six commands by hand. Adoption friction
is an assurance defect: a control nobody runs protects nothing.

THE KILL CRITERION THIS MODULE IS BUILT AROUND, quoted from the wave 8 spec
because it is the whole point: if a truthful summary cannot be produced
without this file running the suites (`tools/test_sbe_*.py`,
`evals/run_evals.py`) or becoming a second gate runner (`sbe_design.py`,
`sbe_gate.py`, `sbe_score.py`), it stops and says so rather than run them.
Nothing in this file starts a subprocess and nothing in it computes a NEW
verdict over source code. It reads state other commands already recorded:
`sbe evidence` receipts, the `sbe task` registry, an intake file, a
disposition file, and the diff itself (read the same way `sbe impact` already
reads it, by importing that module rather than re-typing the git plumbing).
A design, gate or score FAIL surfaced here is read out of an EXISTING,
already-verified evidence receipt someone generated with `sbe evidence run`;
a check this project owns but nobody ran a receipt for is reported under
MISSING EVIDENCE, never invented as a FAIL this module discovered on its own.

WHERE THIS MODULE LOOKS, stated because a store this module does not check is
a store whose absence must never read as clean:

  intake            <root>/00-intake.json, or <dossier>/00-intake.json per
                     discovered dossier when the flat file above is absent
  disposition       <root>/disposition.json, or <dossier>/disposition.json,
                     matching whichever intake was actually read
  evidence store    <root>/.sbe/evidence/  (recursively, every *.json)
  task registry     <root>/.sbe/tasks.json

The evidence store and task registry are always shared and root-level: read
once, the same way, for the whole repository, exactly as `sbe status --team`
already reads them. Intake and disposition are read flat at `<root>` FIRST,
the same single-dossier convention `tools/test_sbe_impact.py`'s own fixtures
write to, and when that flat `00-intake.json` exists this module's output is
unchanged from every earlier version of this file: the flat layout always
wins and dossier discovery never runs. Only when the flat file is ABSENT does
this module walk for dossiers, through the SAME `_design_roots`/
`_team_changes` machinery `build_team_report` below already uses (the
default `design/` root, plus any `.sbe/team-profile.json` `designRoots`
entry that resolves inside the repository; an entry that would escape the
repository is refused and named as a merge blocker, never silently walked).
Each discovered dossier's own `00-intake.json` and `disposition.json` are
then read in the flat file's place, one target per dossier, and every
finding they produce is labeled with the dossier's name so a reader always
knows which change it came from. A repository that writes neither the flat
files nor any dossier still reads NO-DATA here, exactly as before.

ACTIVE CONFLICTS reuses wave 5's overlap scan by calling `tasks.load_registry`,
`tasks.open_tasks` and `tasks.claims_overlap` directly, the same three
functions `sbe task check` itself calls; there is no second copy of the
overlap rule in this file.

HOW A DESIGN/GATE/SCORE OBLIGATION IS CLEARED, and this changed because the
old answer was a bypass. A receipt whose `sbe evidence verify` verdict is PASS
(the receipt itself is trustworthy: sealed, current, every covered file intact)
clears an obligation only when the receipt DECLARES that kind in its own
`checkKinds` field, read through `evidence.declared_kinds`, which is the single
reader of that field. Nothing here looks at the recorded command line any more.
It used to: the kind was inferred by substring-matching the joined argv, so a
receipt recording `/bin/cat tests/test_design_of_gate_score.txt` named three
obligations and cleared all three, for a command that ran no check at all. That
was reproduced, not theorized.

A receipt that declares no kind is NO-DATA for obligation purposes, never a
silent pass, and the three shapes of that (a receipt older than the field, a
field that does not parse as a kind list, and an honest run that declared
nothing) are each named where MISSING EVIDENCE is reported, so a reader is
never told "no evidence exists" when the truth is "evidence exists and says
nothing about which check it was". A receipt whose recorded `exitCode` is
nonzero is a MERGE BLOCKER whether or not it declares a kind: the run was made,
it failed, and evidence of that failure already exists. A receipt whose own
verify() is NO-DATA (advisory: a dirty tree at generation time, or no covered
file) is neither a broken claim nor clean evidence, and is not otherwise pinned
in a section; it is counted in the evidence scope note.

LANE B-004: on the CR-06 discovered-dossier path, "clears an obligation" is
scoped PER CHANGE, not read off one repository-wide set. The evidence store
is still scanned once, shared and root-level, exactly as stated above; what
changed is which dossier a given receipt is allowed to clear. A receipt is
attributable to a dossier when a registry task record belonging to that
dossier's own `08-plan.json` claims it by `evidenceId`, or when every one of
its `coveredFiles` falls inside a path that dossier's plan `owns`. Before
this, a gate receipt generated for change A cleared change B's MISSING
EVIDENCE obligation too, purely because both dossiers consulted the same
global `kindsCovered` set; that was reproduced, not theorized, with a
two-dossier fixture. A receipt attributable to no dossier at all is
UNSCOPED: on the flat single-dossier layout it still clears the obligation
exactly as it always has (this scoping never runs there, so that output
stays byte-identical), but on the discovered-dossier path it clears no
dossier's obligation, and the MISSING EVIDENCE finding says so by name
("a matching receipt exists but is unscoped") rather than staying silent
about a receipt that plainly exists in the store. See
`_dossier_evidence_attribution`.

WHAT A DECLARED KIND IS NOT: a proof that the command performed that check.
`sbe evidence run --kind gate` binds the declaration to a run that actually
happened and seals it, so it cannot be typed into a receipt afterwards, and the
recorded argv sits beside it for a reader to compare. An operator who declares
a kind over a command that checks nothing has written a false statement rather
than exploited an inference, which is the whole of the improvement and is
stated here rather than oversold.

Python floor is 3.9: no match statements, no `X | Y` annotations. Standard
library only. Maturity: INTERNAL-EVAL, exercised on this repository's
fixtures and on no other estate.

    itself without re-reading every receipt off disk a second time; see
    `_dossier_evidence_attribution`).

    Every receipt verifies with the evidence store ITSELF excluded from its
    covered files: `evidence_mod.verify` is called with `exclude_dirs` set to
    `evidence_dir`'s path relative to `root`, the same spelling `coveredFiles`
    entries use. A receipt's `coveredFiles` normally comes from a diff, not a
    hand-picked list, and that diff cannot distinguish "code this run tested" from
    "another receipt that happened to land in the same base..HEAD range". A
    receipt regenerated at a fixed `--out` path (the ordinary shape of a CI
    re-run) is not a change to the code under test, and without this
    exclusion an unrelated receipt that merely covered its OLD bytes by
    diff-range accident would FAIL the moment it refreshed: the evidence
    store poisoning itself. See docs/KNOWN-LIMITS.md ("Evidence covering
    evidence") for exactly what this closes and does not.

    A receipt CLAIMED BY A TASK RECORD verifies against that task's own tree:
    when a registry record's `evidenceId` equals the receipt's `runId` and the
    record still declares a worktree directory that exists, `verify` runs with
    that worktree as its cwd, because the receipt is evidence for the task
    branch's head, and reading it against the root checkout would misreport
    every finished task's own evidence as a broken claim (the gap the golden
    scenario disclosed through rc.10). The resolution is disclosed on the
    clean entry (`verifiedIn`, `task`, and the finding sentence itself). A
    claimed receipt whose worktree is gone, an unclaimed receipt, and an
    unreadable registry all verify against root exactly as before: linkage
    that cannot be read never upgrades a verdict.

    Reproduced before this function existed: `_scan_evidence`'s own
    `kindsCovered` is a single GLOBAL set, computed once over every receipt
    in the store with no notion of which change it belongs to. A gate
    receipt generated for change A therefore cleared change B's MISSING
    EVIDENCE obligation too, the moment both dossiers were discovered in the
    same run, purely because the same global set was consulted for both.

    A receipt is attributable to a dossier when EITHER: a registry task
    record claims the receipt by `evidenceId` (the receipt's `runId`
    matches) AND that record is genuinely THIS dossier's own task, OR every
    one of the receipt's `coveredFiles` falls inside a path that dossier's
    plan `owns` (`sbe_fence_hook.paths_overlap`, via `tasks.paths_overlap`,
    the same containment rule task ownership is judged by everywhere else in
    this project; a receipt that also covers a file outside the dossier's
    declared ownership is not a clean claim of that dossier's obligation and
    is not attributed to it on that path). A receipt attributable to no
    dossier at all stays UNSCOPED: it is left out of every dossier's
    coverage below, on purpose, rather than guessed at.

    "Genuinely this dossier's own task" is deliberately NOT just "the
    record's `id` is one this dossier's plan also names": every derived plan
    starts fresh at T01 (`build_team_report`'s own scope-conflict code,
    right below this function, states the identical fact for the identical
    reason), so two sibling dossiers routinely each declare a task of their
    own also called "T01", and an id match alone would let a registry record
    that truly belongs to dossier A get read as dossier B's claim too,
    reopening the exact class of cross-dossier bug this function exists to
    close. A record only counts as a dossier's claim when, IN ADDITION to
    the id match, the record's own declared `ownedPaths` overlap a path that
    dossier's plan `owns`: the same containment check the coveredFiles path
    above already uses, applied to the registry's own claim instead of the
    receipt's.

    Returns (`coveredByName`: {dossier name: set(kind) actually attributed
    to it}, `unscopedPaths`: {kind: [receipt path, ...]} for receipts
    declaring that kind but attributable to no dossier, `attributedNames`:
    {kind: {dossier name: [receipt path, ...]}} for receipts declaring that
    kind and attributed to some dossier), so a caller reporting a kind a
    dossier still owes can say WHY a matching receipt did not clear it
    (unscoped, or landed on a different dossier) instead of staying silent
    about a receipt that plainly exists in the store.

# LT-302.B: the smallest possible read path for `12-handover.json` (LT-301's
# explicit-human-handover artifact), so `sbe status` can say whether
# ownership of a change is moving to someone else, and to whom, without
# becoming a second copy of the engine that writes it.
#
# This module never imports `brothersbe.handover`: that module already
# imports THIS one (`handover.cmd_prepare` derives its summary from the same
# task-registry and evidence readers this file owns), so a reverse import
# would be a cycle. What is read here is deliberately smaller than
# `handover.read_handover`'s own fourteen-field check: only `status` (to
# tell prepared/acknowledged/rejected apart) and `headSha` (for the same
# bound-commit staleness compare convergence, approval and review are
# already held to, in `build_team_report` below). `_read_handover_record`
# mirrors `_read_review_record`'s three-state law exactly: a missing record
# is NO-DATA (nobody is handing this change to anyone, a fact, never a
# block, per LT-302.B's own instruction); a record present but unparseable,
# not an object, or carrying a `status` this installation has never
# written, is a broken claim, worse than silence.
#
# The result is intentionally NOT folded into `build_team_report`'s
# severity 1..11 findings list. That range is already pinned twice: this
# project's own contract test (`test_every_finding_carries_the_full_
# contract` in tools/test_sbe_status_team.py) hard-asserts `1 <= severity
# <= 11`, and the LT-202 structured-findings note a few hundred lines below
# states the same law in prose ("never invents a severity outside 1..11").
# A handover is explicitly never a merge blocker of its own ("do not make
# handover absence a blocker when ownership is not changing" -- LT-302.B),
# so it does not need a severity slot to be visible: both `build_report` and
# `build_team_report` return a new, purely additive `handover` list, one
# entry per change, and a caller reads it by name, exactly the way LT-302's
# skill is told to read every other status field: JSON, never prose
# interpretation.
