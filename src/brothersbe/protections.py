"""`sbe protections verify`: is the repository itself protecting the control plane.

Spec of record: BrotherSBE_RELEASE_BLOCKERS_FOR_FABLE.md item 5 (5.1 CODEOWNERS,
5.2 the ruleset for the default branch, 5.3 this verifier). The fixtures in
tools/test_sbe_protections.py drive this module directly through `evaluate` and
`render`; the calling convention they pin (the report dict shape, the
three-value fetch contract, the control names) is authoritative here.

The point of the command, in one sentence: a green workflow is not a merge gate
unless the repository requires it, and nothing inside this repository can prove
that the repository requires it. So this command asks GitHub, and when it cannot
ask, it says so instead of guessing.

Laws this file carries, mirrored from its sibling src/brothersbe/prverify.py:

- Read-only client. The only code path that leaves the machine is `_gh_fetch`,
  it shells out to `gh api` with no method flag (gh sends GET when none is
  given), and it refuses any method other than the literal "GET" before it
  builds an argument vector. The fetch function is a PARAMETER of `evaluate`,
  so every fixture injects a canned one and no test ever opens a socket.
- THE NO-NETWORK PATH, and it is the honest one. When no token is discoverable
  or `gh` is not on PATH, this command makes ZERO requests and reports NO-DATA
  once per network fact it could not check, each with the same remedy. NO-DATA
  is never a pass. It is also not, by itself, proof of a broken repository: the
  BrotherSBE release checklist is what treats it as BLOCKING, and RELEASE_NOTE
  below says exactly that in the tool's own output so the operator reads it
  next to the verdict rather than in a document somewhere else.
- The CODEOWNERS leg needs no network at all and therefore always runs. A
  missing or uncovering CODEOWNERS file is a FAIL, not a NO-DATA: the file is
  local, this command read the local tree, and absence that was actually
  looked for is evidence.
- The token is never persisted, never printed, never written into the report;
  the report records only which discovery source supplied it, by name, and
  every detail string is scrubbed against the token value before the report is
  returned.
- UNVERIFIABLE is a fourth report-level verdict, exactly as in prverify: these
  controls live here, not in a Check registry, so the check-registry law of
  three is untouched. The rendered report states that in its own header.

HONEST LIMIT ON THE FIELD NAMES. The endpoint shapes below (the branch rules
list, the ruleset detail and their parameter keys) are pinned by the canned
fixtures in tools/test_sbe_protections.py and were NOT confirmed against a live
GitHub response while this file was written, because this engine has zero
network egress. That is why every parameter this file reads is read
defensively: a key that is absent from the response is NO-DATA ("present but
unreadable"), never a PASS and never silently a FAIL. If a live run reports
NO-DATA on a fact the repository really does configure, the field name here is
what to fix, and the fixture is what pins the fix.

Python floor is 3.9, standard library only.
