"""`sbe pr verify`: live GitHub evidence for one pull request, bound to its head.

Spec of record: docs/specs/2026-07-30-sbe-pr-verify.md. The fixtures in
tools/test_sbe_prverify.py drive this module directly through `evaluate` and
`render`; the calling convention they pin (the report dict shape, the
three-value fetch contract, the control names) is authoritative here.

Laws this file carries:

- Read-only client. The only network code path is `_real_fetch`, it sends GET
  and nothing else, pins Accept to application/vnd.github+json, holds the
  Authorization header in memory only, and runs under a hard timeout. The
  fetch function is a PARAMETER of `evaluate`, so every fixture injects a
  canned one and never opens a socket.
- The token is never persisted, never printed, never written into the report;
  the report records only which discovery source supplied it, by name. As a
  belt on top of that design, every detail string is scrubbed against the
  token value before the report is returned (the same posture as
  src/brothersbe/evidence.py redact_argv, applied to the one secret this
  command can hold).
- Missing credentials are NO-DATA with a remedy and a nonzero exit, never a
  clean verdict in either direction: absence of evidence is not evidence of
  absence. With no token, ZERO network attempts are made.
- Every HTTP failure maps to a verdict from the spec's table; a traceback
  reaching the user is a defect.
- UNVERIFIABLE is a fourth report-level verdict for this command only. These
  controls live here, not in a Check registry, so the check-registry law of
  three is untouched; the rendered report states that in its own header.
- A later commit invalidates: the pull request resource is fetched FIRST to
  learn the head sha every control is evaluated against, and LAST to detect a
  force-push mid-run. A race is UNVERIFIABLE with re-run prose.

Python floor is 3.9, standard library only.
