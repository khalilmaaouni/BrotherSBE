"""`sbe book`: the booklet, with its reference tables generated from canonical state.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The feature list, the roles, the checks with their severities
and the honest limits used to be written out by hand across several
documentation surfaces, free to disagree, with nothing detecting it when they
did. This project's whole argument is that a claim earns trust in proportion to
how mechanically it can be checked, so a hand-typed feature list inside a
document arguing for derived evidence is the product contradicting itself in
public.

This module makes those tables derived: parsed from the files that already
define them, spliced between explicit markers in the booklet, and bound to the
SHA-256 of every source read, so a source that moves without a rebuild is a
FAIL naming the section and the file.

WHY THE BOOKLET IS HTML AND NOT MARKDOWN. It carries inline SVG figures, pull
quotes, scene boxes, capability stamps and panels, none of which survive a
markdown subset. The acts are hand-authored HTML under `docs/fieldbook/booklet/`
and concatenated in filename order; this module owns only the generated blocks
and never rewrites a byte outside a marker pair. The design is in
`design/field-book/`, tier T2, and `tools/sbe_design.py` passes on it.

WHAT IS DERIVED AND WHAT IS NOT, because the distinction is the product. Five
sections are generated: the guided commands, the CLI commands, the reviewer
roles, the registered checks with their severities, and the honest limits. A
sixth, the provenance block, is generated from the other five. Everything else
is prose a human wrote. The cover's declared version is the one freshness stamp
over that prose, and a stale one reports NO-DATA rather than FAIL, because
nobody can compute whether prose went wrong, only that nobody has looked since.

DERIVATION BY IMPORT WHERE THE SOURCE ALLOWS IT. The commands renderer imports
`brothersbe.cli` and reads its `COMMANDS` table as the object it is. The checks
renderer calls `brothersbe.decisions.registries()`, the discovery this
repository already uses in `evals/test_no_data_class.py`, so a check registered
next year appears on the day it is registered rather than the day somebody
remembers to list it. Only `docs/KNOWN-LIMITS.md`, which is prose, is parsed as
text, and it reports NO-DATA naming the file when the parse recovers nothing.

DETERMINISM. No wall-clock is read anywhere here and no absolute path is written
into any output, so the same tree built twice produces byte-identical files.
`bindings.json` therefore records no timestamp: the question `--check` asks is
whether the booklet matches the sources NOW, and git already holds the history
of when each binding moved.

FAIL, NO-DATA AND PASS ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE. A source that cannot be read or
parsed is a FAIL carrying the exception. A source that reads cleanly and yields
zero items is NO-DATA naming why, never an empty table a reader would take to
mean "there are none". Under `--check --strict`, only FAIL decides the exit
code, consistent with every other check this repository ships.
