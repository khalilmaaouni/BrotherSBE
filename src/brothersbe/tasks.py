"""A structured registry of who owns what, and a diff postcondition at close
that compares what ACTUALLY changed against what was declared.

The defect this exists for, in one sentence: the write fence is a PreToolUse
hook that fails open and cannot govern Bash, because shell cannot be parsed
reliably, so a writer who edits through the shell walks past the only control
standing in front of the keyboard.

The fix is not a better parser. `sbe task open` records what a writer declared
it owns, and `sbe task close` reads the git diff and refuses to close a task
whose tree changed outside that declaration. The shell is never parsed; the
diff is simply read. This is the AFTER-THE-FACT layer of a two-layer model:
`tools/sbe_fence_hook.py` stays the advisory pre-write control and is not
touched by this module, and the overlap rule is IMPORTED from it rather than
re-typed, so the fence a hook refuses over and the fence this registry refuses
over cannot drift into two different fences.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, stated here because a control that oversells itself is
worse than none:

  - It cannot see an actor who never registers. Reviewer separation and the
    ownership scan order roles INSIDE the registry; a writer who never runs
    `sbe task open` is invisible to both, and only the fence hook (advisory,
    fail-open) stands in front of that writer.
  - Concurrent CALLERS who never go through `cmd_open`/`cmd_close` are out of
    scope: a caller that reads and rewrites `.sbe/tasks.json` by hand, past
    this module entirely, is not serialized by anything here, the same way a
    writer who never runs `sbe task open` is invisible to the ownership scan
    two bullets up. Both entry points this module ships now hold
    `_registry_lock` for the whole read-modify-write, the same `fcntl.flock`
    sidecar pattern `tools/sbe_telemetry.py` and `brothersbe.decisions` use,
    so two concurrent `sbe task open` (or `close`) calls can no longer both
    read the same tasks list and have the second write silently erase the
    first's addition. `save_registry` itself is still the same atomic write
    (temp file, then rename) it always was; the lock lives around it, in the
    caller, because the read has to be inside the same critical section as
    the write for a lost update to be impossible, and `save_registry` alone
    never saw the read.
  - `expiry` is informational only. Nothing deletes a task on a clock; a stale
    open task is a line a human reads in `sbe task list`, never a record the
    tool silently drops.
  - The registry file `.sbe/tasks.json` and its lock sidecar
    `.sbe/tasks.json.lock` are exempted, by exact name, from the changed-path
    comparison: opening a task writes both, so counting either would make an
    ordinary single-writer flow unable to close clean without --force, which
    is this control's own kill criterion.

Python floor is 3.9: no match statements, no `X | Y` annotations. Standard
library only. Maturity: INTERNAL-EVAL, exercised on this repository's fixtures
and on no other estate.
