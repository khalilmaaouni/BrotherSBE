"""Plan 12.4, Lane C4: doc-truth for docs/guides/00-sandbox.md.

Run: python3 tools/test_sbe_sandbox.py

The doc-truth idiom this project already uses (`evals/run_evals.py`'s
`dc7`, `evals/replay_guide05.py`, `evals/replay_book.py`): a page that claims
"every command was run and every block of output is what it printed" is only
true if something mechanical keeps checking it. This suite builds the exact
sandbox `tools/fixtures/sandbox/build_sandbox.py` builds, drives the exact
eight-step sequence `docs/guides/00-sandbox.md` walks a reader through
through the REAL engine (`bin/sbe` and the `tools/sbe_*.py` scripts, as real
subprocesses, real git, nothing mocked), and asserts that every verdict line
the guide quotes is a line the tools actually printed there.

Scope, stated once here rather than left implicit (the golden scenario
suite's own discipline, `tools/test_sbe_golden_scenario.py`): THREE kinds of
line are deliberately NOT held to a byte-exact match, because no sandbox
build can make them portable, and the guide says so at each one:

  1. `sbe evidence run`'s duration (a real clock reading) and the receipt id
     `sbe work finish` prints (derived from the receipt's own bytes,
     including that duration): checked as a fixed prefix and suffix around
     the variable middle, never the exact digits.
  2. The absolute worktree path `sbe work start` prints, and every absolute
     path this suite's OWN temp-dir build produces (`sbe review` and `sbe
     handover prepare` both print one): checked as a fixed prefix and
     suffix, never the path itself, because the guide's path
     (`~/sbe-sandbox/...`) and this suite's (a fresh `tempfile.mkdtemp()`)
     are never going to be the same string, and neither would a real
     reader's `~` expand to what either of us has.
  3. `sbe doctor`'s `tools`, `plugin-manifest`, `vault` and `private-names`
     lines: `tools` and `plugin-manifest` name wherever THIS install lives
     on disk, which is a different path (and, after a version bump, a
     different version string) on every machine and in every clone; `vault`
     and `private-names` read the CALLING machine's own environment
     variables and home directory, which this suite explicitly clears (see
     `_STRIP_ENV` and `_clean_env`) to get the same honest "not configured
     yet" reading the
     guide shows, but which a real reader's own machine may answer either
     way. Only `identity` is pinned exactly: it reads the SANDBOX repository's
     own local git config, which `build_sandbox.py` sets, so it reads the
     same on every machine. `sbe review`'s "CHECKS FED BY A VAULT OR
     REGISTRY" block (11 of its 12 lines, `citation-inventory` through
     `review-cadence`) is EXCLUDED from this suite entirely for the same
     reason: those checks are about the INSTALLING MACHINE and the
     INSTALLED SKILL'S OWN TREE, never about the say-hello change, and the
     guide says so in prose rather than pinning the counts.

Red-first, mirroring this project's own "no invented transcripts" discipline
in place of a source-code behavior change: `TestSandboxJourneyMatchesGuide`
below was first run against a copy of the guide with one line deliberately
wrong (a mismatched tier and a mismatched recommendation both proved a
mismatch failure, never an ERROR, before either line was corrected to what
the tools actually printed).
