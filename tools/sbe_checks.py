"""The registry contract every BrotherSBE check is registered under.

Why this file exists. Six named instances of one defect were fixed by hand and
the same defect was found alive in four more places inside the same files. A
check that reports PASS over evidence it never examined converts absence into
false assurance, which is the failure this whole project exists to prevent. One
more hand fix would have removed six more instances and left the class.

So a check is no longer just a function. A check is a function PLUS a mechanical
declaration of what it reads, what its empty states are, and a worked positive
example of its evidence:

  reads          the evidence file(s) or tree the check opens
  kind           how that evidence is shaped, which decides what "malformed" means
  item_key       for a JSON receipt holding a list, the key naming that list
  empty_expect   the verdict when the evidence exists and declares nothing
  full_fixture   evidence that SHOULD pass, from which the honesty test derives
                 the empty-value shapes mechanically
  full_expect    the verdict full_fixture produces, PASS unless the check cannot
                 reach PASS on any evidence this host can build, in which case
                 full_expect_reason says why and is printed on every run
  optional_leaves fields in full_fixture the PASS sentence does not assert over,
                 each with a stated reason, printed on every run

Two rounds of this fix modelled "absent evidence" as an absent FILE, and the
defect survived as absent VALUES: a receipt that exists, parses, carries every
key, and holds "" in all of them. `full_fixture` exists so that no one has to
think of that shape again. The honesty test hollows the declared fixture leaf by
leaf, subtree by subtree, and whole, in empty strings, whitespace and nulls, and
requires that none of it produces a PASS. A field nobody empties is a field
nobody tested.

A fourth round found the same defect one level deeper again: the value was
present, non-empty, and vacuous. `snapshot_id: "TODO"` with `primary` and
`secondary` both `"pending"` produced "1 figure(s) each with a pinned,
independently re-derived, zero-drift check" and exit 0. The defence already
existed in this repository, as a private constant in one tool that no gate
imported, which is why VACUOUS_VALUES and `answered()` live in THIS file: one
definition, imported everywhere, extended in one place.

empty_expect can never be PASS. The constructor refuses it.

What that guarantee is, exactly, stated without overclaim after three rounds of
this claim being too broad: the DECLARATION is enforced by this constructor (a
check cannot be registered that names PASS as its empty state, and cannot be
registered without a positive fixture to hollow), and the RUNTIME is tested by
evals/test_no_data_class.py over the registries it discovers and the scenarios
it derives. It is not a proof over all inputs. It is an enforced declaration plus
a mechanical scenario sweep, and the sweep prints its own coverage so the claim
is checkable rather than asserted.

    The ACCESS axis. Seven review rounds probed what the evidence SAYS: absent
    files, absent keys, empty values, vacuous values, wrong order. The axis nobody
    probed was whether the tool could OPEN the evidence at all: a chmod 000 source
    file vanished from a lint's count, a chmod 000 registry file turned two FAILs
    into two PASSes whose sentences said "none", and a FIFO where a receipt was
    expected hung every tool forever with no verdict in either mode.

    The rule, in one place so every tool applies the same one: a path that is
    absent is an absence (the caller's NO-DATA); a path that EXISTS and cannot be
    read is a broken claim and is named. A FIFO, socket or device is refused here
    BY ITS STAT, before any open(), because open() on a FIFO blocks forever and a
    gate that vanishes is worse than a gate that fails.

    Returns "" both for an absent path and for a readable regular file: the
    caller distinguishes those two with os.path.lexists, which never blocks.

    An "absent" path is only known to be absent when the tree above it can be
    entered. The axis was closed on the evidence FILE and stayed open one level
    up: chmod 000 on a PARENT directory made lexists() return False, the
    caller read that as an absence, and a FAIL became a NO-DATA (or a PASS
    saying "none") over evidence sitting on disk. So absence is now checked
    against the nearest existing ancestor: if that ancestor cannot be entered,
    this path's existence is unknowable, which is a broken claim and is named.

    it already does for soft readings inside `_pair_could_render_same`.

    The defect this closes, measured at 8 of 220 real names across two

    LENGTH, and a genuine name reduced to 9, 11 or 13 characters was

      same kind      a letter is read as a letter, a space as a space
                     (_glyph_class). Unicode decides this for every code point,
                     so it is knowledge the opaque verdict never lacked.
      a function     one character has ONE rendering, so the same character
                     may not be read as two different letters of the target.
      one-for-one    distinct characters render as distinct letters. This is
                     the word "one-for-one" doing its job: three different
                     Devanagari letters cannot all be the `n` of `not known`,
                     while a forged `TODO` spelled in Lisu uses one letter per

    cannot distinguish from a placeholder is treated as an ANSWER rather than
    accused. The cost is a placeholder spelled so that every requirement above
    holds by coincidence; the cost of the other direction was calling real

    ORDER, and the order was wrong everywhere. The vacuity test ran on the RAW
    value and the reduction ran after it, so every reduction this project performs
    could manufacture a fresh non-answer that nothing rechecked. The shipped case:
    `second_derivation: "#"` is not blank, is not in VACUOUS_VALUES and survives
    `answered()`; `derivation_fold` then turns it into the empty string; the gate
    compared "" against a real query, found them different, and printed the
    strongest sentence this project owns over a derivation that computes nothing.
    The same hole exists for every reduction: strip comments, strip a currency
    symbol, split a table cell, fold a wrapped line.

    Reduce first. Test second. This is the one function that does it in that
    order, and the call sites that reduce anything go through it.

    A reduction is defined on TEXT, so a field that reduces is a text field, and
    a value the reduction cannot read is not an answer to it. The old escape:
    `reduce` was applied only `if isinstance(v, str)`, so `"query": 0` and
    `"second_derivation": 1` skipped the whole R7 fix and two integers bought
    "a second derivation whose text differs beyond case, whitespace and
    comments", a sentence about text over fields holding none.
