"""Fixtures for `sbe status`. Run: python3 tools/test_sbe_status.py

Every test here builds a real git repository in a temporary directory and runs
the real command against it. Nothing is mocked, because the defect this
control exists for lives exactly at the seam between what several other
commands recorded and what a reader has to assemble by hand, and a mocked
store would test the mock.

Evidence receipts are generated with the real `sbe evidence run`, over a
stand-in command that declares its check kind with `--kind` instead of being a
real gate or score run. That is deliberate and stated here once: this suite
pins status's OWN reading of the declared field, not `sbe_gate.py` or
`sbe_score.py` themselves, which already have their own fixtures. A real gate
run would make every fixture slower and would not exercise the reading any
more thoroughly.

`TestCheckKindIdentity` below is the exception that has to be read: it pins the
BYPASS, a receipt whose command line spells design, gate and score and which
must clear none of them. Status used to derive the obligation from that text.

Commands are always `sys.executable`, never a system binary picked up from the
machine: the interpreter running this file is the one executable a fixture can
prove exists, and the defect being pinned is about what a receipt SAYS, not
about which program did the saying.

    ordinary shape of a CI re-run (the design/gate/score checks all write to

    receipt that merely covered its OLD bytes by diff-range accident must

    Every fixture here leaves the "gate" receipt UNCOMMITTED on purpose. A
    receipt's `headCommit` is resolved at generation time, before it can be
    committed, so ANY receipt that is later committed necessarily records a
    headCommit one commit behind whatever HEAD becomes once that commit
    lands: `verify` FAILs it for that reason alone, correctly and
