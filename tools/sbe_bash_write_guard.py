"""BrotherSBE PreToolUse Bash guard: the early half of the write boundary
(release blocker 1, BR-1014).

WHY THIS EXISTS
  `tools/sbe_authority_hook.py` and `tools/sbe_fence_hook.py` sit in front of
  Edit, Write, MultiEdit and NotebookEdit, which name their target in a
  structured field. Bash names nothing. Until this file, these four commands
  walked straight past both guards:

      printf '%s\\n' 'replacement' > CLAUDE.md
      python3 -c "open('.claude/settings.json', 'w').write('...')"
      sed -i 's/old/new/' hooks/hooks.json
      rm -f .sbe/tasks.json

  `tools/sbe_fence_hook.py::WRITE_TOOLS` says so in its own comment, and
  `docs/BYPASS-COVERAGE.md` row 20 recorded it as UNCOVERED until this file and
  `tools/sbe_session_reconcile.py` landed together. This file covers the obvious
  half of it and says plainly which half that is. Row 19 (a hook disabled) is
  unchanged: `BROTHERSBE_BASH_GUARD_OFF` is the same cooperating-control
  weakness every hook here has, and it announces itself rather than being
  silent.

WHAT THIS FILE IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
  It is an EARLY WARNING and an immediate blocker for a positively identified
  protected write. It is NOT the authoritative control, and it must never be
  described as one. Arbitrary shell can write through a generated script, a
  compiled binary, an interpreter this file does not know, a here-document, a
  process substitution, or a command whose target is computed at run time, and
  no parse of the command TEXT can see any of that. The authoritative control
  is `tools/sbe_session_reconcile.py`, the Stop hook, which inspects the
  repository changes that actually survived rather than the command that was
  typed.

  So the two honest sentences about an ALLOW from this file are:

      This command was not positively identified as a protected write.
      This command was NOT proven to be read only.

  Nothing in this file, its stderr, or its decision JSON ever says the second
  thing differently. That is spec item 1.3 rule 8, and it is the reason the
  allow path here is silent rather than reassuring.

THE THREE RULES THIS FILE OBEYS, INHERITED VERBATIM FROM ITS SIBLINGS
  1. FAIL OPEN, LOUDLY, EXCEPT FOR THE ONE REFUSAL IT EXISTS TO MAKE. An
     unparseable command, an unterminated quote, an oversize command line, an
     unimportable helper, an unreadable task registry, any unexpected
     exception: all of them ALLOW and print why to stderr. The single
     exception is the whole point of the file: a candidate path that is
     POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED as a protected family, reached by a write
     construct this file understands, and not covered by an open task's
     declared `ownedPaths`, is REFUSED.
  2. STDOUT IS THE DECISION CHANNEL AND NOTHING ELSE. Two output funnels
     (`_out`, `_warn`) and no bare `print` anywhere, exactly as
     `tools/sbe_fence_hook.py` and `tools/sbe_authority_hook.py` are built.
  3. ONE PARSE, NEVER A SECOND COPY. Path canonicalization
     (`canonical_target`), scope overlap with its case-fold confirmation
     (`paths_overlap`, `_same_entry_case_insensitive`) and the nine detected
     authority families (`_matched_surface`, reached through
     `sbe_authority_hook.confirmed_surface` so the case-fold handling comes
     with it) are IMPORTED from the modules that already own them. This file
     adds exactly one list of its own, `CONTROL_PLANE_PATTERNS`, for the
     control-plane families the spec names that no existing module owns yet.

Python 3.9, standard library only, cross-platform, no network, no subprocess.
No em or en dashes anywhere in this file, its comments, or its output.
