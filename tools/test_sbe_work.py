"""Fixtures for `sbe work`. Run: python3 tools/test_sbe_work.py

Spec of record: docs/specs/2026-07-30-sbe-work-lifecycle.md. These fixtures
assert exactly what that document says, nothing else: a disagreement between
this file and the eventual src/brothersbe/work.py is a defect in one of them,
never a negotiation settled here.

At the time this file was written, `bin/sbe` has no `work` subcommand at all,
so every invocation below fails at argument parsing (usage, exit 2) before it
reaches anything this suite actually asserts about. Every test here is
expected to FAIL against that gap (never ERROR: no import crash, no fixture
crash) because each test's FIRST assertion checks the `work` call itself, and
a failing assertion there stops the test immediately, before any later line
that assumes infrastructure (a real worktree, a real branch, a real registry
record) `sbe work start` would have created. That red is the point: tests
first, and the same test keeps proving more of the spec as work.py is built
out underneath it, with no rewrite needed here.

Two fixture techniques, both borrowed rather than invented:

  - Real dossiers and a real derived plan, built and read through the landed
    `sbe plan --write` (Loop 1), exactly mirroring the dossier body constants
    and the render_verification()/_find_task()/_find_migration_triplet()
    helpers in tools/test_sbe_plan.py. Copied here rather than imported,
    because suites in this project stay standalone; a disagreement between
    the two copies would be a defect to fix in both, not a shared import to
    chase.
  - Registry records seeded directly into .sbe/tasks.json, the same technique
    tools/test_sbe_tasks.py uses in TestOverlap to test `sbe task check`
    against a collision nothing ever opened honestly. `check`, `finish`, and
    `remove` all read that one registry file, so a scenario that would have
    been produced by `sbe work start` (an open record, a real git worktree)
    can be built directly and inspected on its own, without depending on the
    part of `sbe work` this loop has not written yet.

Every fixture builds a real git repository in a fresh tempfile.mkdtemp() (git
init, one seed commit) and, where a scenario needs one, a real git worktree
inside that same tempdir via `--worktree-dir`. Nothing here ever touches the
real repository this file lives in, and nothing is mocked: the defect this
whole command exists for lives at the seam between what a task declared and
what the tree and the registry actually show, and a mocked diff would test
the mock.
