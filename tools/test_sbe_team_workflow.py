"""LT-103: end-to-end team execution fixtures. Run: python3 tools/test_sbe_team_workflow.py

Spec of record: docs/plans/2026-08-04-lean-team-rebase.md (the LT-101/102/103
chain, vertical slice 1, /brothersbe:work) plus docs/specs/2026-07-30-sbe-work-
lifecycle.md, which tools/test_sbe_work.py and tools/test_sbe_work_brief.py
already exercise piece by piece. This file proves the WHOLE chain together,
in one scratch repository per test, driving the real `sbe work` and `sbe
status` surfaces as separate subprocesses, never mocking the engine.

The scratch repository carries a validated 08-plan.json with four tasks:

  T01  backend writer, owns src/widgets/lookup.py
  T02  docs writer, owns docs/widget-lookup.md (disjoint from T01)
  T03  reviewer, dependsOn T01, reads (never owns) src/widgets/lookup.py
  T04  a PLANTED overlap: a writer whose owns is the SAME path as T01's,
       dependsOn T01

The plan is written directly as JSON rather than derived through `sbe plan
--write` from an ADR/data-model/verification dossier: this file's four task
kinds (backend, docs, test, overlap) do not map onto that derivation's fixed
taxonomy (decision / forward-reverse-reconciliation / row), and the plan task
schema is already the documented contract both `sbe plan` and `sbe work` read
(LT-101's inventory in the plan doc above: id, title, role, dependsOn, owns,
readOnly, acceptance, verificationCommands, requiredEvidence,
requiredReviewers, dossierSources), so writing it by hand reads that same
contract rather than inventing a second one. The plan is still validated
through the real `sbe plan` command before any test trusts it (see
`_write_dossier_and_plan` below), the same discipline
tools/test_sbe_work.py's own `_plan()` helper applies to its derived plan.

T04's dependsOn edge on T01 is not decorative. tools/sbe_plan.py's
plan_ownership check refuses a plan where two writer tasks' owns sets share a
path and the dependency graph does not order them (and the derivation side,
build_plan's rule 8, adds exactly this edge automatically whenever it detects
the same overlap) -- so a plan carrying the planted overlap WITHOUT this edge
would refuse validation for every task, backend and docs included, not just
the overlap task. With the edge in place, T01 and T02 are ready (no unmet
dependency) and start freely; T04 is blocked behind T01 by the same
dependency-not-closed refusal that blocks any other unmet dependency, which
is this system's actual mechanism for serializing two writers who would
otherwise collide on one path.

Fixture technique copied from tools/test_sbe_work.py rather than imported:
suites in this project stay standalone. A real git repository in a fresh
tempfile.mkdtemp() (git init, one seed commit), real `sbe work start`
worktrees inside that same tempdir, real subprocess calls to `bin/sbe`,
nothing mocked.
