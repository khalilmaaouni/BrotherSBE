"""Bypass fixtures: the ways a person or an agent gets past these controls.

Run: python3 tools/test_sbe_bypass.py

An external review listed 35 ways this system could be bypassed. This file holds
the ones that can be exercised on a laptop with no network, no GitHub
credentials and no warehouse. `docs/BYPASS-COVERAGE.md` is the table: one row per
scenario, each row COVERED, UNREACHABLE HERE or UNCOVERED, and it is the
deliverable. This file is only the part of that table that runs.

Every fixture builds a real temporary git repository and runs the real tool
against it, matching `test_sbe_impact.py` and `test_sbe_evidence.py`. Nothing is
mocked, because a bypass lives at the seam between an artifact and a claim about
it, and a mocked seam would test the mock.

TWO KINDS OF FIXTURE LIVE HERE, and confusing them would be worse than having
neither, so they are named apart.

  A CONTROL fixture proves the bypass is caught: the verdict is not PASS, and
  the evidence line says why. `test_an_invented_review_id_...` is one.

  A LIMIT fixture proves the bypass WORKS, and carries `_is_a_limit` in its
  name. It exists so that the limit is a decision somebody made rather than a
  surprise somebody finds, exactly as
  `test_argv_is_recorded_verbatim_which_is_a_limit_not_a_leak_to_ignore` does in
  `test_sbe_evidence.py`. A limit fixture asserts the current behaviour AND
  asserts that the sentence the tool prints does not overclaim, because the
  overclaim is the part that would actually mislead somebody. Its scenario is
  UNCOVERED or UNREACHABLE HERE in the table, never COVERED.

A green run of this file means the covered scenarios were tested. It means
nothing about the scenarios the table marks UNREACHABLE HERE or UNCOVERED.
