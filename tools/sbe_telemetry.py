"""BrotherSBE telemetry: the mechanical half of the learning loop. Schema 2.

Subcommands:
  outcomes-append   SessionEnd hook target. Reads hook JSON on stdin, parses the
                    session transcript, appends ONE atomic JSONL line to the ledger
                    (schema 2: GenAI semconv token names) and scans the MAIN
                    transcript's short operator messages for correction candidates.
  migrate           One-time ledger migration to schema 2 (idempotent, temp+rename,
                    line-count recheck; never backfills absent values).
  scorecard         Renders the 9-metric dashboard from the ledger + companion files.
  rate              Records a operator felt-outcome rating (1-5).
  review-mark       Records that a weekly review ran (feeds the overdue nag).
  startup-nags      One-line nags + yesterday's spend for SessionStart injection.
  stop-warn         Stop hook target, WARN ONLY (never blocks): systemMessage JSON
                    when a qualifying session has no vault session log today.
                    Cheap short-circuits only; never parses the transcript.
  registry-check    Flags fence-registry lines that look live in a stale file.
  fence-lint        Dispatch aid: prints live fences from the project's STATE.md
                    and the BROTHERSBE_REGISTRIES globs before a writer launches.
  prediction-audit  Counts sealed predictions in the operator model ledger.
  check-update      OFFLINE check of your installed copy: warns when an already
                    fetched update is waiting, when the copy has gone stale, and
                    once when the law itself changed under you. Reads git refs as
                    plain files: no network call, no subprocess, ever.
  intent            Write-ahead intent log. `intent "next: X, because Y"` appends
                    one line to a per-project log BEFORE a risky/long action, so a
                    death always leaves a forward-looking record (the write-ahead
                    log pattern: log the intent before the action, like a database).
                    The resume brief surfaces the last intent first.
  precompact-brief  PreCompact hook helper. Category `transcript`, opt-in like
                    every other category (BROTHERSBE_TELEMETRY_TRANSCRIPT=1): off
                    (the default) writes NOTHING and names the switch once on
                    stderr; on, it reads the TAIL of the dying session's transcript
                    (last instruction, recent decisions, recent commands) and
                    writes a resume brief to the vault, so a resumed session
                    recovers the THREAD, not just the files the git autosave saved.
                    Pure: reads/writes files only.
  compact-hint      SessionStart(source=compact) helper. Reads the hook JSON on
                    stdin; if the session just resumed from a compaction, prints a
                    one-line pointer to the autosave recovery command. Pure: reads
                    stdin and prints, no subprocess, no network.
  handoff           One shareable, SECRET-REDACTED markdown for handing a project
                    to a small team: overview + open items + latest session + recent
                    outcomes, assembled from the vault. Pure: reads vault files,
                    redacts, writes one file. No subprocess, no network.
  purge-corrections Deletes captured correction candidates (excerpts of your own
                    messages, secret-redacted and owner-only, but still yours to
                    delete). Shows the count first; --yes to confirm.
  data-show         Every file this tool can write, by name: what it holds, how
                    many records are in it, its mode, and which capture switch
                    governs it. Reads; never writes. -h/--help anywhere in its
                    argv prints usage and exits 0 instead of running.
  data-export       One JSON bundle of everything stored, owner-only, so the
                    stored data can be read somewhere other than the vault.
                    -h/--help anywhere in its argv prints usage and exits 0
                    without touching the vault or writing a bundle.
  data-purge        Deletes what is stored. Shows the inventory first; --yes to
                    confirm; re-checks the filesystem after and reports what
                    survived. --category narrows it to one category. -h/--help
                    anywhere in its argv prints usage and exits 0 without
                    deleting anything.
  speed             Wall-clock view for rubric metric 3: last 7d vs prior 7d,
                    span-hours per OUTCOMES line (labeled proxy, never invented).
  dedup             One-time cleanup of duplicate hook flushes (backup + count
                    check; keeps last flush per identical metric set).

Law: this tool NEVER blocks work. Every hook and automatic path exits 0. The
three data-* commands are the one deliberate exception: a bad flag on one of
them refuses with usage and a nonzero exit rather than run with the flag
silently ignored, because a mistyped flag on a command that reads or deletes
the vault must not be allowed to run as if nothing were wrong. Numbers are
parsed or absent; nothing is invented. Token counts are labeled as-flushed (the
transcript may lag the final turn). Old (schema 1) and new lines are both
readable: use fld() everywhere.

# CAPTURE POLICY. Nothing here is captured unless a switch for that CATEGORY is
# set, and a category that is off is named in the output rather than silently
# skipped.
#
# The defect this closes: this tool parsed the session transcript and stored
# excerpts of the operator's own messages BY DEFAULT, with best-effort redaction
# standing between a customer name, a partner term or an unreleased design and a
# file on disk. Best effort is the right engineering for a redactor and the
# wrong basis for a default: a repository holding customer, partner, security or
# company-confidential material must be able to install this and have it capture
# nothing at all until somebody decides otherwise, per category.
#
# Three categories, three switches, each independent of the others:
#   metrics      the per-session row in outcomes.jsonl. Counts, model names,
#                duration, and the basename of the working directory. No message
#                text, but a directory basename can itself be a client's name,
#                which is why this is opt-in too.
#   transcript   the transcript-derived TEXT in the resume brief: the operator's
#                last message, recent assistant reasoning, recent tool commands.
#   corrections  the correction candidates in corrections.jsonl: excerpts of the
#                operator's own messages.
#
# The organization override forces all three off and no local switch can turn
# one back on. It is read from a policy FILE (default /etc/brothersbe/telemetry-
# policy.conf, a path an ordinary user cannot write on a managed machine) and
# from an environment variable. Its honest limit, stated here and in
# docs/KNOWN-LIMITS.md: this is a policy control on a cooperating machine, not
# an enforcement boundary. Anyone who can edit that file, or run a patched copy
# of this script, is past it.
#
# A policy file that exists and cannot be read, or that carries a directive this
# version does not recognize, FAILS CLOSED: capture is off and the reason says
# which file and which line. A policy nobody could read must never be the reason
# capture was allowed.

# WRITER SERIALIZATION. There used to be no lock anywhere in this repository,

# rename, the loss guard compared two counts taken from the pre-append world
# and agreed with itself, and the operator read "count ok" over a ledger
# missing a live session's row. Two maintenance commands also shared one
# literal ".tmp" path, so one renamed the other's half-written file out from
# under it. The rule: every writer to a ledger file holds this exclusive lock
# (appends briefly, maintenance for its whole read-rewrite-rename-recount),

# after the rename, under the same lock, so nothing can change between what

# Update awareness. This skill is a LAW: when it changes, the change has to be
# read, not silently absorbed. So the notifier does two jobs: tell you an update
# exists, and tell you once when your installed law actually changed.
#
# HARD CONSTRAINT: no network call and no subprocess, ever. Both properties are
# audited and are claimed publicly in SECURITY.md. So this reads git refs as
# ordinary files and never runs git itself. The cost is that "an update exists"
# is only known after something else has fetched; the staleness warning covers
# the rest, by telling you when your copy is simply old.

#: NAMESPACED TO THIS TOOL, and the name is the whole point. This file records
#: which commit of THIS skill the operator last saw, so the next run can say
#: "your installed law changed, read the diff". The bare name
#: "installed-skill-version" is not unique to this tool: the sibling
#: BrotherModeUp keeps the same state, under the same basename, in the same
#: <vault>/99-System/telemetry directory (PARITY.md names the mechanisms the two
#: share). The vault path is the operator's own choice and nothing here reserves
#: it, so pointing both tools at ONE vault is a supported setup, not a misuse.
#: Under the bare name each tool then overwrites the other's stamp every session,
#: and both report a version change on the next start, forever, reading the other
#: tool's commit hash as their own drift. The one mechanism meant to catch a real
#: change becomes a permanent false alarm, which is how a reader learns to ignore
#: it. Observed on a real machine 2026-07-31, the day both vaults were pointed at
