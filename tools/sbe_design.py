"""BrotherSBE design checks: the dossier's completeness rules, made mechanical.

Same contract as sbe_gate.py: one function per class returning (verdict, evidence),
advisory by default, --strict exits nonzero so CI can block. A design artifact that
fails its rule is not approved, and the failure names the missing field.

Where it looks. A directory holding ANY numbered dossier artifact (00-intake.json
or any of 01 through 07) is a dossier and is checked. Anchoring the walk on
00-intake.json alone was a one-file-deletion bypass: seven filled-in artifacts with
the intake removed produced `dossier NO-DATA` and `--strict` exit 0 from the
repository root, so deleting one file evaporated the placeholder check, the ADR
check, the data-model check and the diagram check together. A dossier found without
its intake now FAILs and names the missing file, because without the intake there is
no tier and without a tier there is nothing to require.

Set SBE_DOSSIER_ROOT when a repository is supposed to carry a dossier, and a search
that finds none there becomes a FAIL instead of an absence. A directory that holds
dossier-shaped files without being live design work (the shipped templates, a
finished project's dossier from two years ago) carries a `.sbe-exempt` file whose
contents say why, and the report prints that reason on every run as a WAIVER
instead of the directory blocking every unrelated merge forever. The reason meets
the same reviewability threshold as a tier override: a zero-byte `.sbe-exempt`
turned a failing dossier into exit 0 while the report printed the sentence
"`.sbe-exempt` names why: no reason recorded", which asserts a reason and names
its absence in the same breath. An exemption states a reviewable reason or it
does not exempt, and a broken one is its own FAIL rather than a quiet gate.
