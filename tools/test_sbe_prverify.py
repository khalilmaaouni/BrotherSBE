"""Adversarial fixtures for `sbe pr verify`. Run: python3 tools/test_sbe_prverify.py

Spec of record: docs/specs/2026-07-30-sbe-pr-verify.md. These fixtures assert
exactly what that document says, nothing else: a disagreement between this
file and the eventual src/brothersbe/prverify.py is a defect in one of them,
never a negotiation settled here.

AT THE TIME THIS FILE WAS WRITTEN, `bin/sbe` has no `pr` subcommand at all (it
is not in cli.py's COMMANDS table) and src/brothersbe/prverify.py does not
exist. Two different RED shapes follow from that, and both are deliberate:

  - Tests that drive `bin/sbe pr verify` as a subprocess (argument and
    no-token behavior) fail as ordinary assertion FAILUREs: argparse's
    "invalid choice" usage error is real output, so `assertIn("NO-DATA", ...)`
    and friends simply do not find it yet. No import, no crash, exactly the
    same style tools/test_sbe_work.py used for `sbe work` before it existed.
  - Tests that drive src/brothersbe/prverify.py DIRECTLY (the canned-response
    control logic the brief requires, because the module takes an injectable
    fetch and this suite must never open a socket) cannot reach that
    checkpoint at all without importing the module first. Every one of those
    classes imports it in setUp(), so every test in them ERRORs today at
    setUp with a clean ImportError, one time, in one place, rather than a
    scattered AttributeError per test. That ERROR is entirely attributable to
    the missing module, never to a bug in this file: nothing below this point
    in any such class ever runs, so nothing below it can be a fixture bug.

ZERO NETWORK. No test here ever calls the real GitHub API. The CLI tests only
exercise argument parsing and the no-token path (no fetch ever happens before
a token is even sought); the control-logic tests inject FakeFetch, defined
below, which answers from an in-memory table and asserts GET-only itself.

ASSUMED CONTRACT. The spec pins the CLI surface, the control names, the four
verdicts and the security rules; it deliberately leaves the Python-level
calling convention to whoever writes the fixtures first, so here it is,
written down once rather than guessed at twice:

  brothersbe.prverify.evaluate(repo, number, token, fetch=None, cwd=None,
                               head=None, policy=None) -> a report dict:
    {"tool": "sbe pr verify", "repository": repo, "number": number,
     "headSha": <the head sha last observed, or None>,
     "controls": [{"name": <CONTROL NAME>, "verdict": "PASS"|"FAIL"|
                   "NO-DATA"|"UNVERIFIABLE", "detail": <str>}, ...],
     "final": one of the four verdicts}
    Control names are the exact spec strings: "PR EXISTS", "PR HEAD",
    "AUTHOR KNOWN", "INDEPENDENT APPROVAL", "BOT APPROVAL", "REVIEW THREADS",
    "CODEOWNERS", "REQUIRED CHECKS", and "EVIDENCE FRESHNESS" only when `cwd`
    names a local evidence store. `fetch=None` means "use the real network
    transport"; a fixture always passes a FakeFetch instead.

  brothersbe.prverify.render(report) -> str, the human-readable form. Its
  header carries repository, PR number and head sha; its last line names the
  FINAL verdict.

  fetch(method, url, token) -> (status, body, error). Three values, never
  two: a two-value return here would read as a possible (verdict, evidence)
  pair to evals/test_no_data_class.py, the honesty meta-test, and this is not
  a verdict source either. `method` is always the literal "GET" (the
  read-only law TestReadOnlyLaw enforces at the source level, below).
  `status` is the HTTP status code, or None when the network was
  unreachable. `body` is the parsed JSON (dict or list), or None. `error` is
  a short string naming what went wrong, set only when `status` is None. The
  module is expected to call the PR resource endpoint (a URL containing
  "/pulls/<number>") FIRST, to learn the head sha everything else is
  evaluated against, and LAST, to detect a force-push mid-run (the spec's own
  words: "the head sha is fetched last and compared to the sha each control
  was evaluated against"). The other endpoints this suite cans: a URL
  containing "/pulls/<number>/reviews", one containing "/check-runs", and one
  containing "CODEOWNERS".

  These are decisions this loop had to make to hand the next one a concrete
  target, not a re-reading of the spec. A disagreement between this contract
  and the implementation is a defect in the implementation to fix, never a
  reason to loosen a fixture.
