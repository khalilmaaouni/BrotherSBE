"""The public install path, as a release test rather than a dated claim.

Run: python3 tools/test_sbe_public_install.py

WHY THIS EXISTS. The README told a stranger to run two commands and said they
had been "executed end to end against this public repository on 2026-08-01".
That is a date-stamped memory, not a check, and it was the only thing standing
behind the first thing every new user does. Founder instruction, 2026-08-07:
the public install and the installed workflow become a non-skippable release
test, because the projects with the best adoption make installation the boring
part rather than an experimental capability.

WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT PROVE, stated here rather than left for a reader to
discover. It runs offline and touches no network, so it CANNOT prove that
GitHub serves the repository today or that a marketplace fetch succeeds. What
it does prove is everything that has actually broken here before: that the
manifests a fetch would land on are valid and agree with each other, that the
commands the front page tells a stranger to type are the commands that exist,
and that the entry point the install leads to is real. The network half is
named in docs/KNOWN-LIMITS.md and belongs to a job with credentials.
