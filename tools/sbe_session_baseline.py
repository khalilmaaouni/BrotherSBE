"""BrotherSBE session baseline: what the working tree looked like BEFORE this
session touched it (release blocker 1 item 1.2, BR-1014).

WHY THIS EXISTS
  `tools/sbe_session_reconcile.py`, the Stop hook, is the authoritative half
  of the write boundary: it judges the repository changes that actually
  survived a session rather than the commands that were typed. To do that it
  has to answer one question the working tree cannot answer on its own:

      Which of these changes did THIS SESSION make?

  A repository is routinely dirty before a session starts. Attributing that
  dirt to the session would refuse every session that opened on an unfinished
  branch, and the reconciler would be useless within a day. Ignoring a
  pre-existing dirty file forever would be the opposite mistake: an agent
  could hide a protected write inside a file that happened to be dirty
  already. So the baseline records not only WHICH paths were dirty but WHAT
  THEY CONTAINED, as a digest, and the reconciler compares content rather
  than a path list. That is the difference between spec fixture 11 (a dirty
  file left untouched is not attributed) and fixture 12 (the same file
  changed again IS attributed), and it is why this file hashes.

WHERE IT LIVES, AND WHY THERE
  `<git-dir>/brothersbe/sessions/<session-id>/baseline.json`, where <git-dir>
  is `git rev-parse --absolute-git-dir`, so a linked worktree gets its own
  baseline under `.git/worktrees/<name>/` instead of sharing the primary
  tree's. Inside the git directory rather than the working tree on purpose:
  it is not a source file, it must never appear in `git status` (a control
  that dirties the tree it is measuring is a control that reports itself),
  and it is out of the way of every glob this project ships.

  A baseline the agent can delete is a control the agent can remove. This
  file cannot prevent that, and does not pretend to: `sbe_session_reconcile`
  treats an ABSENT baseline as a fail-closed condition rather than as
  permission, which is the half of the problem that is solvable here.

NULL DELIMITED GIT OUTPUT, EVERYWHERE
  Every git invocation that returns paths uses `-z`. A path containing a
  newline is legal on every filesystem this project supports, and a
  line-oriented reader would split one changed file into two paths that do
  not exist, which is exactly the shape a hostile write would take to hide.

Python 3.9, standard library only, no network. Subprocess is used for git and
nothing else. No em or en dashes anywhere in this file or its output.
