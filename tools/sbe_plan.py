"""BrotherSBE plan: dossier to task graph, deterministically.

Spec of record: docs/specs/2026-07-30-sbe-plan-derivation.md. The fixtures in
tools/test_sbe_plan.py and this file both read from that document, and a
disagreement between them is a defect in one of the three, never a negotiation.

Two surfaces, one truth:

  sbe_plan.py <dossier-dir> [--write] [--json] [--strict] [--cwd <repo>]
      Default: validate design/<change>/08-plan.json against the dossier with
      the PLAN_CHECKS registry below. --write derives the plan from the dossier
      first, writes 08-plan.json, then validates what was written with the same
      rules. An empty derivation writes NOTHING and exits 1, because the
      essentials law says an empty plan must never return success.
  sbe_plan.py <check-name> <dossier-dir>
      One check by name, advisory: the verdict line is the result and the exit
      code stays 0, exactly as sbe_gate.py answers the honesty meta-test. The
      full run keeps the src/brothersbe/cli.py convention instead (0 ok, 1 a
      control failed, 2 usage) because `bin/sbe plan` is a control surface.

Honesty law inherited from the chassis: absent evidence is NO-DATA, never PASS.
Derivation reads the dossier's own structures and nothing else; the planner
never invents a task, and a gap the dossier never answers (a migration with no
rollback row, a contract change with no compatibility claim) is a refusal that
names the gap, not a blank to fill in.
