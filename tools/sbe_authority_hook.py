"""BrotherSBE PreToolUse authority-file guard: LT-402.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  `tools/sbe_instruction_surface.py` (LT-401) proves, AFTER a commit lands,
  whether an authority-bearing file (CLAUDE.md, .claude/**, .mcp.json,
  .claude-plugin/**, hooks/**, agents/*.md, skills/*/SKILL.md, CODEOWNERS,
  .github/workflows/**) changed outside a declared, reviewed scope. That is a
  git-history check: it names the defect once the commit already exists. This
  file is the same question asked BEFORE the write, at the one moment a
  PreToolUse hook can still refuse it: a dispatched worker editing one of
  those files without having declared it in the task it was given would be
  quietly widening its own authority, and the after-the-fact check would only
  ever learn about it once that was already true.

  This is deliberately narrower than `tools/sbe_fence_hook.py`. The fence hook
  enforces "one writer per file" against a hand-written markdown registry for
  EVERY file a fence names. This file enforces "an authority-bearing file may
  only move inside a task's own declared `ownedPaths`" against the structured
  wave-5 task registry (`.sbe/tasks.json`, `src/brothersbe/tasks.py`), and
  ONLY for the nine authority-surface families. It does not replace the fence
  hook and is not replaced by it; the two run side by side, named as separate
  entries in `hooks/hooks.json`.

THE SAME LAW THE FENCE HOOK STATES, WITH ONE NAMED EXCEPTION
  Every failure path in this file (an unreadable or corrupt task registry, an
  unimportable helper, an unparseable payload, no target path, any unexpected
  exception) FAILS OPEN, allows the write, and prints why. That part is
  identical to `tools/sbe_fence_hook.py` and for the identical reason: a hook
  that fails closed on its own bug stops the operator's own work, which is
  worse than no hook at all.

  The one exception, and it is the whole point of this file: when the target
  is POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED as an authority-bearing surface, the registry was
  read successfully, and no OPEN task's declared `ownedPaths` covers it, this
  is not an error. It is the rule doing its job, and the rule fails CLOSED:
  the write is refused. Nothing else in this file ever denies a write.

REUSE, NOT A SECOND COPY
  The nine-family authority-surface list lives in exactly one place,
  `tools/sbe_instruction_surface.py::_matched_surface`, and this file imports
  it rather than re-typing it, so the check that runs after a commit and the
  guard that runs before a write can never drift into two different lists.
  The write-tool surface, target-path extraction, path canonicalization, and
  the case-insensitive-filesystem confirmation are the same story a second
  time: all four are `tools/sbe_fence_hook.py`'s, imported here rather than
  copied. The task-scope reader (`load_registry`, `open_tasks`) is
  `src/brothersbe/tasks.py`'s own, imported for the same reason: the registry
  shape a human writes with `sbe task open` and the registry shape this hook
  reads must be the one shape, not two that happen to agree today.

  Every one of those imports is by file path, deferred into a function, never
  a bare `import` at the top of this file. `tools/` is not a package and this
  hook is invoked by Claude Code with an arbitrary working directory, so a
  bare `import sbe_fence_hook` would resolve against sys.path and could pick
  up a different checkout entirely. An import failure at any of the three is
  a FAIL-OPEN printed to stderr, never a traceback Claude Code would surface
  as a broken hook in front of every edit.

THE WORKER-CONTEXT SIGNAL, STATED AS A LIMIT RATHER THAN A PROMISE
  When an authority file is undeclared and NO open task exists at all (an
  absent or empty registry), refusing every such edit unconditionally would
  block the ordinary case this project runs in every day: a human operator,
  in an interactive session, editing CLAUDE.md directly, with no task
  registry in play at all. So this file only refuses an UNDECLARED authority
  edit when a "worker context" is detectable, and states plainly what that
  detection is and is not: `_worker_context` below, and
  `docs/KNOWN-LIMITS.md`. This is a heuristic, not a proof, and the file says
  so everywhere the heuristic decides something.
