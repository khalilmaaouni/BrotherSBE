"""BrotherSBE Stop hook and CI backstop: the AUTHORITATIVE half of the write
boundary (release blocker 1 items 1.4 and 1.5, BR-1014).

WHY THIS EXISTS
  `tools/sbe_bash_write_guard.py` reads command TEXT. Text cannot show what a
  generated script, a compiled tool, a here-document, a process substitution
  or a path computed at run time will do, and the spec says so in its own
  words: "Do not attempt to solve this only by parsing shell syntax ... The
  authoritative fix must inspect the actual repository changes, not only the
  command text."

  This file inspects the changes. It runs as the Claude Code `Stop` hook, so
  it sees the working tree as the session is trying to finish, and it runs in
  CI as `sbe scope verify --base <ref> --head HEAD --strict`, so a committed
  change is judged by the same rules whether or not Claude Code was ever
  installed on the machine that made it.

WHICH DIRECTION THIS FILE FAILS, AND WHY IT IS THE OPPOSITE OF ITS SIBLINGS
  `sbe_fence_hook.py` and `sbe_authority_hook.py` sit in front of the
  keyboard, so they fail OPEN: a hook that failed closed on its own bug would
  stop the operator from working at all.

  This one runs at the END. Failing open here means a session ends with an
  undeclared protected change sitting in the tree and nothing said, which is
  the exact defect the blocker names. So this file FAILS CLOSED on the four
  conditions spec 1.4 item 9 lists:

      1. A protected path was positively identified and is undeclared.
      2. The task registry is unreadable.
      3. The baseline is missing or corrupt.
      4. The repository root changed.

  Blocking on a missing baseline has one carve-out, and it is stated here
  rather than discovered later: when the working tree holds NO change at all
  relative to HEAD, there is nothing to attribute and nothing to be out of
  scope, so a missing baseline allows and says so on stderr. A missing
  baseline with a dirty tree blocks. That keeps "the agent deleted the
  baseline" from becoming permission (spec 1.4, last paragraph) without
  blocking every session that starts on a machine where SessionStart never
  ran and nothing was changed.

WHAT COUNTS AS DECLARED
  Three things, and nothing else:
    1. An open task in `.sbe/tasks.json` whose `ownedPaths` covers the path.
    2. A LIVE fence in the fence registry (STATE.md) naming THIS session as
       sole writer and covering the path.
    3. A valid record in `.sbe/break-glass.json`: a reason, an owner, an
       expiry that has not passed, a named approver, and the path listed.
       This is spec 1.4 item 10's "explicit reviewed break glass record". It
       is reported as BREAK GLASS in the output, never as a clean result.

THE NAMED LIMIT
  A NON-protected path outside every declaration is a violation only when the
  session is operating under a declaration at all (at least one open task).
  With an empty task registry, an ordinary interactive session has declared
  nothing, is outside nothing, and is not blocked for editing its own source
  files. Protected paths block regardless. This is the same worker-context
  reasoning `tools/sbe_authority_hook.py::_worker_context` states for the
  write-time guard, applied at the end of the session instead of the start of
  a write, and it is a HEURISTIC about intent, never a proof.

Python 3.9, standard library only, no network. Subprocess is used for git and
nothing else. No em or en dashes anywhere in this file or its output.
