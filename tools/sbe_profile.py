"""The profile: which surfaces load, and the invariants that keep the default small.

Why this file exists. An external assessment scored this project high on rigor and
low on release readiness, and named the cause: everything shipped switched on. A
first-time reader met the vault, the telemetry ledger, team coordination, the policy
control plane and the release controls before they had designed anything. The fix is
not a shorter law file. It is a DECLARATION a user can set, a default that genuinely
loads less, and a check that fails when a module leaks back into that default.

What the default profile is: the safety floor (the ground map, one writer per file,
fence then dispatch, never claim done without a verifying command) plus design,
implementation boundaries and verification. Nothing else. The five optional modules
and their triggers are in `references/modules.md`; the declaration is
`.brothersbe/profile.json`.

What this tool does NOT do, stated rather than implied. It does not gate a law. All
nineteen laws stay reachable from SKILL.md's own routing table at every profile, and
`check` FAILS if one stops being reachable, because a law that vanishes with a
module switched off is worse than a long law file. It gates SURFACES: the reference
files a session loads, and the ONE startup emitter the SessionStart hook gates.

Which modules are actually enforced, stated here and not only in the table. Only
`telemetry` has a mechanism that reads the declaration: the `startup-nags` emitter
in `tools/sbe_sessionstart.sh`, guarded by an `enabled telemetry` call to this tool.
`vault`, `team`, `policy` and `release` are DECLARED BUT NOT ENFORCED: they carry
that exact phrase in `references/modules.md`, because nothing reads the declaration
for them and switching them changes nothing a machine can observe.
`check_module_enforcement` below is what keeps that honest, by refusing any
enforcement claim whose named file does not ask this tool about that module.

Why `release` is in that list rather than gating the hook's update check, since a
draft of this lane did gate it. `check-update` prints the notice that the governance
engine itself changed under the user since their last session. Gating it meant an
upgraded install stopped seeing that notice, silently, as a side effect of a size
optimisation: a trust regression, not a size win, and the bytes it saved are
measured in `references/modules.md` rather than asserted. The notice is now
unconditional, the release module's scope excludes it by decision, and this file
therefore names no emitter that module owns.

Verdict shape. The four checks below return a (name, verdict, evidence) triple and
print through `say`. They are deliberately not registered `Check` objects in a
registry: the mechanism that enforces them is `tools/test_sbe_profile.py`, a test
that re-injects each defect and watches the verdict go FAIL. Registering them in
`tools/sbe_score.py` (so the honesty meta-test sweeps them and CI blocks on them
through an existing step) is the named follow-up, and it needs fixtures this lane did
not build.

Absent evidence is NO-DATA, never a pass, exactly as everywhere else here: a routing
table that could not be read, or that holds no rows, is NO-DATA carrying the reason,
and NO-DATA never decides an exit code.
