"""Regression tests for the BrotherSBE session baseline and Stop reconciler
(BR-1014, release blocker 1 items 1.2, 1.4 and 1.5).

Run: python3 tools/test_sbe_session_reconcile.py

Standard library only. Every fixture builds a REAL git repository in a temp
directory and makes the change through the filesystem or through a generated
script, never by handing the reconciler a synthetic change list. The whole
claim of this control is that it reads what actually survived, so a test that
fed it a made-up survivor would be testing the opposite thing.

THREE PROPERTIES CARRY THIS FILE.

  IT CATCHES WHAT COMMAND PARSING CANNOT. A generated shell script, a
  deletion, a rename, and a symlink write are spec fixtures 4, 5, 6 and 7.
  None of them is visible in the text of the command that started them, and
  all four are asserted here against the surviving repository state.

  ATTRIBUTION IS BY CONTENT, NOT BY NAME. Spec fixtures 11 and 12: a file that
  was already dirty when the session opened is NOT this session's while it is
  untouched, and IS this session's the moment its content changes again. A
  path list cannot tell those apart, which is why the baseline stores digests.

  IT FAILS CLOSED, AND THE NAMED RECOVERY ACTUALLY WORKS. The four fail-closed
  conditions from spec 1.4 item 9 each have a fixture. And the refusal names
  three recoveries, so `test_the_named_recovery_actually_clears_the_block`
  performs one (restores the file) and replays the identical reconciliation to
  prove the door opens, exactly as tools/test_sbe_fence_hook.py does for the
  fence hook's own escape.

CALIBRATION. Every assertion here was run RED against a deliberately broken
copy of the reconciler before it was run green against the real one. The
mutations used were (a) making `attribute` return every current change (which
breaks fixture 11, the pre-session dirt case) and (b) making
`read_baseline`'s absence path allow instead of raise (which breaks the
missing-baseline fail-closed case). Both are recorded in the BR-1014 patch
note.
