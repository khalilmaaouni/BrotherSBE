"""Fixtures for the registered check registry (`.sbe/checks.yml`) and the
binding between a receipt and the check it claims to be.
Run: python3 tools/test_sbe_check_registry.py

THE DEFECT THESE EXIST FOR. `sbe evidence run` proves a process started, was
timed and exited. It did not prove WHICH check ran, so `-- true` minted a clean,
sealed, commit-bound receipt and `--kind`, a word the caller typed beside it,
was the only thing naming the obligation it answered. Every test below is
written against that: the first two prove `true` cannot buy a migration
rehearsal, and the rest prove that the registered check it must be instead stays
bound to the registry, the runner bytes and the covered files.

Every test builds a real git repository in a temporary directory, writes a real
registry into it, runs the real CLI and reads the receipt that came out. Nothing
is mocked, because the defect lives exactly at the seam between a command and a
claim about it and a mocked subprocess would test the mock. Receipts are written
OUTSIDE the repository under test, so minting one never dirties the tree it
covers.

CALIBRATION. Each test names, in its own docstring, what it saw before the
control existed: with `checkId` outside the seal and `checkKinds` accepted as
identity, the receipts built here verified and satisfied policy. The sentences
recorded in each docstring are the observed red state, not a prediction.
