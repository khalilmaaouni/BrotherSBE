"""Plan 12.4, Lane C4: the ten minute sandbox, a disposable practice repository.

Not frozen bytes. Like `tools/fixtures/golden-scenario/build_scenario.py`
(the idiom this module mirrors), the sandbox is built FRESH, every run, in a
directory the caller owns (normally a fresh `tempfile.mkdtemp()`): a real
`git init`, a real README, a real one-task dossier and a hand-authored
`08-plan.json` validated through the real `sbe plan` before anything trusts
it. Nothing here is a snapshot of another run; the same call produces the
same bytes because every value is a pure function of its arguments.

Smaller than the golden scenario, and human-facing rather than test-facing:

  - ONE task, not four. The golden scenario proves "at most three writers
    plus a reviewer" as a property of a team plan; the sandbox exists to let
    a single beginner feel `start -> evidence -> finish -> review ->
    handover` without first understanding a team.
  - Friendly names throughout (`say-hello`, `src/hello/greeting.py`,
    `migrations/0001_greeting_log.sql`), not `T01`/`widgets`/`golden-
    scenario`: a reader unfamiliar with this project's own test fixtures
    should recognize every path as something a tiny real service would
    actually have.
  - A README this module writes into the repo's own seed commit, so a
    beginner who opens the built directory in a file browser -- never mind
    a terminal -- sees the whole ten-minute journey named in one file,
    step by step, before running a single command.
  - No `00-intake.json` and no `03-adr.md` written here: those two are the
    beginner's OWN first actions in the walkthrough (`sbe intake`, then
    `sbe decide` and a manual accept), not something this builder does for
    them. Everything this module writes is background the walkthrough
    references (the notes the plan cites, the plan itself), never the
    steps the walkthrough teaches.

This scenario stays intentionally at intake tier T0 (see
`tools/sbe_intake.py:compute_tier`): reversible, no contract change, no
sensitive data, no downstream consumers. T0 requires zero dossier artifacts,
which is the whole point for a ten-minute demo -- the beginner sees a real
tier decision without first being asked to write seven documents to earn it.

Nothing here calls `sbe work start`, `sbe evidence run`, `sbe work finish`,
`sbe review` or `sbe handover prepare` itself -- that sequencing belongs to
whatever drives the sandbox one step at a time (`docs/guides/00-sandbox.md`
for a human, `tools/test_sbe_sandbox.py` for this project's own doc-truth
check), so every assertion or every quoted line can bind to the exact
command that produced the state it reads.

Spec of record: plan 12.4, Lane C4, "the ten minute sandbox".
