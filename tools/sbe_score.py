"""BrotherSBE weekly code-graded checks (Anthropic eval guidance: many small
code-graded checks; LLM judgment only for the residue). Reads the telemetry
ledger and fence registries; prints PASS / FAIL / NO-DATA per check with the
evidence inline. Advisory by default (exit 0); `--strict` exits nonzero on any
FAIL, and on a crash, so CI can block. Honest outputs only: a check without data
says NO-DATA, never PASS.

Every check is registered in CHECKS with a declaration of the evidence it opens
(see sbe_checks.py). Three of these checks used to read `PASS if not <empty list>`,
so a fresh checkout with an empty ledger printed "0 pre-schema-2 lines remain PASS"
and two more like it: the project's headline law inverted inside the project's own
scorer, in its default state. A corpus with no rows supports no verdict about
compliance, so those checks now say NO-DATA and name the file they found nothing in.
