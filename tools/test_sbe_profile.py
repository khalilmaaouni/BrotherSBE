"""Profile fixtures: a module cannot leak into the default, a law cannot go unreachable.

The guarantee this file exists to hold, in one sentence: the default profile is the
safety floor plus design, implementation boundaries and verification, and every one of
the nineteen laws still resolves from SKILL.md's routing table whatever the profile is.

Every test here is CALIBRATED the way this repository requires: it copies the shipped
tree into a scratch directory, re-injects the exact defect the check exists to catch,
asserts the verdict goes FAIL naming the thing, restores the file, and asserts the
verdict goes back to PASS. A test that stays green with its guard removed is measuring
something else; each case below has been watched go red and green in that order, and
the restoration is asserted rather than assumed.
